To understand how neural activity is propagated between brain regions in order to guide behaviour, we used the all-optical methodology outlined in the previous two sections to compare the neural response during reported and non-reported stimuli (hit and miss trials respectively), both in the directly stimulated region (S1) and an anatomically connected downstream region (S2). 

\section{The structure of evoked activity in S1 and S2}

Qualitatively, hit trials elicit a diverse array of excitatory and inhibitory responses both in S1 and S2, whereas both excitatory and inhibitory responses were less obvious on miss trials. Excited and inhibited cells are also observed in ‘reward only’ trials (methods) in which reward was delivered in the absence of photostimulation, however the population response is less pronounced compared to hit trials, indicating that the response to reported stimulation is not just explained by neural activity driven by reward (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 2,3). We find that hit trials elicit a significantly greater fraction of responsive cells in S1 compared to all other trial types, whereas in S2, hit trials elicited a significantly greater fraction of responsive cells only compared to correct rejection and reward only trials (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). The fraction of responsive cells was greater in S2 compared to miss and false positive trials but this result was not significant (p > 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) (Supplementary Fig. 1,a). On a single cell level, we find individual neurons in S2 that are excited or inhibited in response to hit trials, but not miss or reward only, hinting that reported stimuli are propagated to single neurons in S2 (Fig. 2b).

Data were baselined to the pre-stimulus mean on a cell-wise basis before averaging. Cells are sorted by the pairwise correlation between their trial averaged responses across all three trial types (methods). A clear excitatory and inhibitory response is elicited in S1 and S2 on hit trials that cannot be solely attributed to reward. The intensity of the bar on the right hand side of the hit and miss rasters is proportional to the number of times each cell was directly targeted by the photostimulation beam. Trials in which 150 cells were stimulated were removed for display. Data are blanked while the photostimulation laser was on (pink bar). \textbf{(B)} \textit{Left}: Example S2 cell excited on hit trials (green) but showing no response to miss trials (red) or reward only trials (blue). Each line shows an individual trial. The transparency of the line indicates the number of cells stimulated in S1. Individual trials were baslined to the pre-stimulus mean.

Interestingly however, averaging responses across cells, trials and sessions reveals that hit trials elicit only a modest increase in population activity from baseline, immediately following stimulation, in S1 and S2, followed by a prolonged period of inhibition. Whereas the reward only condition exhibited a very different time course (Fig. 2c,  Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). This hints that both brain regions exist in balanced regimes whereby excitation driven by photostimulation results in inhibition of roughly equal magnitude. Miss trials elicit excitation following photostimulation in S1, however this excitation is not observed as propagated activity in trial-and-cell-averaged responses downstream in S2 (Fig. 2c). 

We next compared how the percentage of excited or inhibited neurons, both locally in S1 and downstream in S2, scaled with the number of cells photostimulated in S1 and whether this differed between perceived and non-perceived stimuli (Fig. 2d,e). As expected, stimulating more neurons in S1 excited a greater percentage of the population regardless of whether the stimulus was perceived (Fig. 2d left) (Pearson’s r = 0.62, p  = 1.8x10-8 hit trials; Pearson’s r = 0.65, p = 2.4x10-9 miss trials). We also find that the percentage of inhibited cells in S1 also scales linearly with the number of cells stimulated (Fig. 2d right) (Pearson’s r = 0.55, p = 1.2x10-6 hit trials; Pearson’s r = 0.59, p = 1.4x10-7 miss trials). This indicates that excitatory photostimulation elicits a compensatory inhibitory response local to the stimulation. In S2, downstream of the stimulation, however the population response to increasing numbers of stimulated cells is more complex. We find no significant relationship between the percentage of excited cells in S2 and the number of stimulated cells in S1 on hit trials or miss trials, although the correlation is an order of magnitude greater on miss trials (Pearson’s r = 0.01, p = 0.9 hit trials; Pearson’s r = 0.17, p = 0.16 miss trials). However we find that the percentage of inhibited cells in S2 scales linearly with the number of stimulated cells in S1 both on hit and on miss trials (Fig. 2e left, right) (Pearson’s r = 0.37, p = 0.002 hit trials; Pearson’s r = 0.45, p = 1.2x10-4 miss trials).

Next, we explicitly quantified the balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) in both brain regions. We find robustly maintained E/I balance in S1 regardless of whether or not the stimulation was perceived, whereby the percentage of cells excited and inhibited is highly correlated (Fig. 2f) (Pearson’s r = 0.84, p < 3x10-19 hit trials; Pearson’s r = 0.85, p < 3x10-19 miss trials). Downstream in S2, we also find E/I balance both on hit trials and miss trials, however the correlation is less strong than in S1, and is weaker on hit trials than miss trials (Fig. 2g) (Pearson’s r = 0.32, p < 0.009 hit trials; Pearson’s r = 0.49, p < 3x10-5 miss trials). Taken together, we show that as activity is propagated away from its site of initiation, E/I balance persists but its strength is reduced. Additionally, perceived stimuli escape the balanced regime downstream to a greater extent than non-perceived stimuli as evidenced by the stronger correlation between the percentage of excited and inhibited cells on miss trials compared to hit trials.

\section{Perceived photostimulation elicit persistent activity in both S1 and S2 populations}

Individual cells display a diverse array of responses, and balanced mean average responses mask the magnitude and time course of propagated activity (Fig. 2). To gain insight into these complex neural responses, we employed logistic regression classifiers on the network level and assessed propagation of stimulus-relevant activity and its relationship to behaviour. We trained classifiers to decode the trial type of individual trials using the activity of all cells in S1 or S2 on imaging data from single imaging frames. This allowed us to uncover the neural signatures of each trial type in both brain regions and quantify the temporal dynamics of this signature. First, we trained a model to classify hit trials from correct rejection trials, meaning the model should detect the neural signature of both the stimulus and the activity resulting in its perception. The classifier performed significantly above chance after stimulation and performance remained well above chance for several seconds both in S1 and S2 (two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) (Fig. 3a left, 3b left; Supplementary Fig. 4a,b,g,h; Supplementary Fig. 5a left, b left). Therefore, the neural activity underpinning perceived stimulation persisted both locally in S1 and downstream in S2 for several seconds. However, the classifier could be decoding the signatures of reward and the motor command required for licking, which are present on hit trials but not correct rejection trials. To address this, we tested the pre-trained classifier on reward only trials in which reward was delivered in the absence of photostimulation. In S1, performance on this trial type was either below or at chance level (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected); in S2, classifier performance on reward only trials remained at chance throughout the first 2.7 seconds of the trial (Fig. 3a left, 3b left; Supplementary Fig. 4a,b,g,h; Supplementary Fig. 5a left, b left) (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected).

Models were trained on each frame individually, with activity from every cell in S1 or S2, and tested on held out data. Coloured bars above the traces show timepoints at which classifier performance was significantly different from chance (see methods).
\textbf{(A)} \textit{Left}: A model was trained on S1 activity to classify hit trials from correct rejection trials and then tested on hit trials (green), correct rejection trials (yellow) and reward only trials (blue). The model is able to classify hit trials from correct rejection trials for several seconds following photostimulation, implying that activity arising from perceived stimulation persists in S1. Reward only trials were not classified as hits, showing that the model was not just trained to decode the neural signature of reward on hit trials. \textit{Right}: A model was trained on S1 activity to classify miss trials from correct rejection trials and then tested on miss trials (red) and correct rejection trials (yellow). The model is able to distinguish the two trial types for only for ~1 second following stimulation. This implies that non-perceived stimuli do not generate persistent activity. \textbf{(B)} \textit{Left}: A model was trained on S2 activity to classify hit trials from correct rejection trials and then tested on hit trials (green), correct rejection trials (yellow) and reward only trials (blue). As above, the model is able to classify hit trials from correct rejection trials for several seconds following photostimulation, implying that activity arising from perceived stimulation in S1 is propagated to S2 and persists for several seconds. Reward only trials were not classified as hits, indicating that the model was not just detecting the neural signature of reward on hit trials. \textit{Right}: A model was trained on S2 activity to classify miss trials from correct rejection trials and then tested on miss trials (red) and correct rejection trials (yellow). The model was not able to classify miss from correct rejection trials at any timepoint, indicating that non-perceived stimuli were not robustly propagated from S1 to S2.

As reward signals in the brain are complex, and depend on whether the reward is expected or unexpected41, we confirmed that the reward signal on hit trials and reward only trials was comparable, thus ensuring that the hit vs correct rejection classifier was indeed classifying the neural signature of perceived stimulation and not just reward. This is critical as the water reward on hit trials was expected, but not expected on reward only trials. We addressed this by training a model to classify reward only trials from correct rejection trials, thus this classifier should detect only the neural signal from rewards (Supplementary Fig. 4e,f). Testing this model on hit trials resulted in identical performance to the reward only condition both in S1 and S2 (no significant difference on 110/110 time points in S1 and 108/110 time points in S2). This means that a classifier trained specifically to detect rewards could not distinguish hit and reward only trials, meaning that the neural response to reward is comparable in both trial types and the classification of hit trials from correct rejection trials is indeed decoding the neural signature of perceived stimulation, both in S1 and S2.

Next we asked whether non-perceived neural activity was reliably propagated from S1 to S2 by training a model to classify miss and correct rejection trials (Fig. 3a right, 3b right; Supplementary Fig. 4c,d; Supplementary Fig. 5a right 5b right). We found that in S1, this model decoded miss trials slightly above chance immediately following stimulation (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), however performance rapidly decayed back to chance level after ~1 second. Conversely in S2, the model did not perform above chance at any point in time, indicating that stimulus information that is not perceived does not propagate to S2.








Taken together, these results show that only perceived stimulus representations are reliably propagated out of the local brain region in which they originate to a downstream brain area. Further, stimuli that are propagated and drive perception persist both locally and downstream for several seconds following the initial injection of activity.
