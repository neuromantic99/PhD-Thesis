I declare that this thesis is my own and that attribution has been given where information was derived from other sources. Aside from the exceptions outlined below, I conceptualised the project, designed and assembled the equipment, performed the experiments, analysed the data and constructed all figures. While all writing contained herein is my own, the project as a whole has relied on key contributions from others. Throughout, the text uses the pronoun `we' indicating myself and the team below.

\textbf{Joshua Keeling}: Collection of \textasciitilde 50\% of the two-photon behavioural data (under supervision from myself). \textbf{Robert Lees}: Performed \textasciitilde 50\% of the surgeries used to collect two-photon behavioural data. \textbf{Thijs van der Plas, Matthias Loidolt, Jonas Dehning, Viola Priesemann}: Assistance with data analysis, particularly logistic regression classifiers. \textbf{Adam Packer}: Conceptualisation of the project and supervision throughout.
