	abstract = {Prefrontal cortex is thought to have a fundamental role in flexible, context-dependent behaviour, but the exact nature of the computations underlying this role remains largely unknown. In particular, individual prefrontal neurons often generate remarkably complex responses that defy deep understanding of their contribution to behaviour. Here we study prefrontal cortex activity in macaque monkeys trained to flexibly select and integrate noisy sensory inputs towards a choice. We find that the observed complexity and functional roles of single neurons are readily understood in the framework of a dynamical process unfolding at the level of the population. The population dynamics can be reproduced by a trained recurrent neural network, which suggests a previously unknown mechanism for selection and integration of task-relevant inputs. This mechanism indicates that selection and integration are two aspects of a single dynamical process unfolding within the same prefrontal circuits, and potentially provides a novel, general framework for understanding context-dependent computations.},

	abstract = {We have measured the point-spread function (PSF) for an MRC-500 confocal scanning laser microscope using subresolution fluorescent beads. PSFs were measured for two lenses of high numerical aperture—the Zeiss plan-neofluar 63 × water immersion and Leitz plan-apo 63 × oil immersion—at three different sizes of the confocal detector aperture. The measured PSFs are fairly symmetrical, both radially and axially. In particular there is considerably less axial asymmetry than has been demonstrated in measurements of conventional (non-confocal) PSFs. Measurements of the peak width at half-maximum peak height for the minimum detector aperture gave approximately 0·23 and 0·8 μm for the radial and axial resolution respectively (4·6 and 15·9 in dimensionless optical units). This increased to 0·38 and 1·5 μm (7·5 and 29·8 in dimensionless units) for the largest detector aperture examined. The resulting optical transfer functions (OTFs) were used in an iterative, constrained deconvolution procedure to process three-dimensional confocal data sets from a biological specimen—pea root cells labelled in situ with a fluorescent probe to ribosomal genes. The deconvolution significantly improved the clarity and contrast of the data. Furthermore, the loss in resolution produced by increasing the size of the detector aperture could be restored by the deconvolution procedure. Therefore for many biological specimens which are only weakly fluorescent it may be preferable to open the detector aperture to increase the strength of the detected signal, and thus the signal-to-noise ratio, and then to restore the resolution by deconvolution.},

	abstract = {Fluorescent calcium indicators are a popular means for observing the spiking activity of large neuronal populations, but extracting the activity of each neuron from raw fluorescence calcium imaging data is a nontrivial problem. We present a fast online active set method to solve this sparse non-negative deconvolution problem. Importantly, the algorithm 3progresses through each time series sequentially from beginning to end, thus enabling real-time online estimation of neural activity during the imaging session. Our algorithm is a generalization of the pool adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA) for isotonic regression and inherits its linear-time computational complexity. We gain remarkable increases in processing speed: more than one order of magnitude compared to currently employed state of the art convex solvers relying on interior point methods. Unlike these approaches, our method can exploit warm starts; therefore optimizing model hyperparameters only requires a handful of passes through the data. A minor modification can further improve the quality of activity inference by imposing a constraint on the minimum spike size. The algorithm enables real-time simultaneous deconvolution of O(105) traces of whole-brain larval zebrafish imaging data on a laptop.},

	abstract = {Light exerts widespread effects on physiology and behaviour. As well as the widely-appreciated role of light in vision, light also plays a critical role in many non-visual responses, including regulating circadian rhythms, sleep, pupil constriction, heart rate, hormone release and learning and memory. In mammals, responses to light are all mediated via retinal photoreceptors, including the classical rods and cones involved in vision as well as the recently identified melanopsin-expressing photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs). Understanding the effects of light on the laboratory mouse therefore depends upon an appreciation of the physiology of these retinal photoreceptors, including their differing sens itivities to absolute light levels and wavelengths. The signals from these photoreceptors are often integrated, with different responses involving distinct retinal projections, making generalisations challenging. Furthermore, many commonly used laboratory mouse strains carry mutations that affect visual or non-visual physiology, ranging from inherited retinal degeneration to genetic differences in sleep and circadian rhythms. Here we provide an overview of the visual and non-visual systems before discussing practical considerations for the use of light for researchers and animal facility staff working with laboratory mice.},

	abstract = {How random is the discharge pattern of cortical neurons? We examined recordings from primary visual cortex (V1; Knierim and Van Essen, 1992) and extrastriate cortex (MT; Newsome et al., 1989a) of awake, behaving macaque monkey and compared them to analytical predictions. For nonbursting cells firing at sustained rates up to 300 Hz, we evaluated two indices of firing variability: the ratio of the variance to the mean for the number of action potentials evoked by a constant stimulus, and the rate-normalized coefficient of variation (Cv) of the interspike interval distribution. Firing in virtually all V1 and MT neurons was nearly consistent with a completely random process (e.g., Cv approximately 1). We tried to model this high variability by small, independent, and random EPSPs converging onto a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron (Knight, 1972). Both this and related models predicted very low firing variability (Cv {\textless}{\textless} 1) for realistic EPSP depolarizations and membrane time constants. We also simulated a biophysically very detailed compartmental model of an anatomically reconstructed and physiologically characterized layer V cat pyramidal cell (Douglas et al., 1991) with passive dendrites and active soma. If independent, excitatory synaptic input fired the model cell at the high rates observed in monkey, the Cv and the variability in the number of spikes were both very low, in agreement with the integrate-and-fire models but in strong disagreement with the majority of our monkey data. The simulated cell only produced highly variable firing when Hodgkin-Huxley-like currents (INa and very strong IDR) were placed on distal dendrites. Now the simulated neuron acted more as a millisecond-resolution detector of dendritic spike coincidences than as a temporal integrator. We argue that neurons that act as temporal integrators over many synaptic inputs must fire very regularly. Only in the presence of either fast and strong dendritic nonlinearities or strong synchronization among individual synaptic events will the degree of predicted variability approach that of real cortical neurons.},

Yet our understanding of how populations of neurons in interconnected brain areas communicate is in its infancy. Here we investigate how trial-to-trial ﬂuctuations of population responses in primary visual cortex (V1) are related to simultaneously recorded population responses in area V2. Using dimensionality reduction methods, we ﬁnd that V1-V2 interactions occur through a communication subspace: V2 ﬂuctuations are related to a small subset of V1 population activity patterns, distinct from the largest ﬂuctuations shared among neurons within V1. In contrast, interactions between subpopulations within V1 are less selective. We propose that the communication subspace may be a general, population-level mechanism by which activity can be selectively routed across brain areas.},

	abstract = {Visual attention, which improves perception of attended locations or objects, has long been known to affect many aspects of the responses of neuronal populations in visual cortex. There are two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses concerning the neuronal mechanisms that underlie these perceptual improvements. The first hypothesis, that attention improves the information encoded by a population of neurons in a particular cortical area, has considerable physiological support. The second hypothesis is that attention improves perception by selectively communicating relevant visual information. This idea has been tested primarily by measuring interactions between neurons on very short timescales, which are mathematically nearly independent of neuronal interactions on longer timescales. We tested the hypothesis that attention changes the way visual information is communicated between cortical areas on longer timescales by recording simultaneously from neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) and the middle temporal area (MT) in rhesus monkeys. We used two independent and complementary approaches. Our correlative experiment showed that attention increases the trial-to-trial response variability that is shared between the two areas. In our causal experiment, we electrically microstimulated V1 and found that attention increased the effect of stimulation on MT responses. Together, our results suggest that attention affects both the way visual stimuli are encoded within a cortical area and the extent to which visual information is communicated between areas on behaviorally relevant timescales.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Visual attention dramatically improves the perception of attended stimuli. Attention has long been thought to act by selecting relevant visual information for further processing. It has been hypothesized that this selection is accomplished by increasing communication between neurons that encode attended information in different cortical areas. We recorded simultaneously from neurons in primary visual cortex and the middle temporal area while rhesus monkeys performed an attention task. We found that attention increased shared variability between neurons in the two areas and that attention increased the effect of microstimulation in V1 on the firing rates of MT neurons. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that attention increases communication between neurons in different brain areas on behaviorally relevant timescales.},

	abstract = {To examine the functional interactions between the color and form pathways in the primate visual cortex, we have examined the functional connectivity between pairs of color oriented and nonoriented V1 and V2 neurons in Macaque monkeys. Optical imaging maps for color selectivity, orientation preference, and ocular dominance were used to identify specific functional compartments within V1 and V2 (blobs and thin stripes). These sites then were targeted with multiple electrodes, single neurons isolated, and their receptive fields characterized for orientation selectivity and color selectivity. Functional interactions between pairs of V1 and V2 neurons were inferred by cross-correlation analysis of spike firing. Three types of color interactions were studied: nonoriented V1/nonoriented V2 cell pairs, nonoriented V1/oriented V2 cell pairs, and oriented V1/nonoriented V2 cell pairs. In general, interactions between V1 and V2 neurons are highly dependent on color matching. Different cell pairs exhibited differing dependencies on spatial overlap. Interactions between nonoriented color cells in V1 and V2 are dependent on color matching but not on receptive field overlap, suggesting a role for these interactions in coding of color surfaces. In contrast, interactions between nonoriented V1 and oriented V2 color cells exhibit a strong dependency on receptive field overlap, suggesting a separate pathway for processing of color contour information. Yet another pattern of connectivity was observed between oriented V1 and nonoriented V2 cells; these cells exhibited interactions only when receptive fields were far apart and failed to interact when spatially overlapped. Such interactions may underlie the induction of color and brightness percepts from border contrasts. Our findings thus suggest the presence of separate color pathways between V1 and V2, each with differing patterns of convergence and divergence and distinct roles in color and form vision.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31\% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40\%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40\%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10\% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment.},

Spike rates varied across neurons, from silence to {\textgreater}60 Hz. Responses were diverse, with some neurons showing large increases in spike rate when whiskers contacted the object. Nearly half the neurons discriminated object location; a small fraction of neurons discriminated perfectly. More active neurons were more discriminative. Layer (L) 4 and L5 contained the highest fractions of discriminating neurons (∼63\% and 79\%, respectively), but a few L2/3 neurons were also highly discriminating.

	abstract = {Texture discrimination is a fundamental function of somatosensory systems, yet the manner by which texture is coded and spatially represented in the barrel cortex are largely unknown. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the rat barrel cortex during artificial whisking against different surface coarseness or controlled passive whisker vibrations simulating different coarseness, we show that layer 2–3 neurons within barrel boundaries differentially respond to specific texture coarsenesses, while only a minority of neurons responded monotonically with increased or decreased surface coarseness. Neurons with similar preferred texture coarseness were spatially clustered. Multi-contact single unit recordings showed a vertical columnar organization of texture coarseness preference in layer 2–3. These findings indicate that layer 2–3 neurons perform high hierarchical processing of tactile information, with surface coarseness embodied by distinct neuronal subpopulations that are spatially mapped onto the barrel cortex.},

	abstract = {Rats, using their whiskers, have excellent capabilities in texture discrimination. What is the representation of texture in rat somatosensory cortex? We hypothesize that as rats “whisk” over a surface, the spatial frequency of a grooved or pebbled texture is converted to a temporal frequency of whisker vibration. Surface features such as groove depth or grain size modulate the amplitude of this vibration. Validation of the hypothesis depends on showing that vibration parameters have distinct neuronal representations in cortex. To test this, we delivered sinusoidal vibrations to the whisker shaft and analyzed cortical neuronal activity. Seven amplitudes and seven frequencies were combined to construct 49 stimuli while recording activity through a 10 × 10 microelectrode array inserted into the middle layers of barrel cortex. We find that cortical neurons do not explicitly encode vibration frequency (f) or amplitude (A) by any coding measure (average spike counts over different time windows, spike timing patterns in the peristimulus time histograms or in autocorrelograms). Instead, neurons explicitly encode the product of frequency and amplitude, which is proportional to the mean speed of the vibration. The quantity Af is an invariant because neuronal response encodes this feature independently of the values of the individual terms A and f. This was true across a wide time scale of firing rate measurements, from 5 to 500 msec. We conclude that vibration kinetics are rapidly and reliably encoded in the firing rate of cortical ensembles. Therefore, the cortical representation of vibration speed could underlie texture discrimination.},

We used a flexible fiber optic image bundle to visualize voltage-sensitive dye dynamics in the barrel cortex of freely moving mice while simultaneously filming whisker-related behavior to generate two movies matched frame-by-frame with a temporal resolution of up to 2 ms. Sensory responses evoked by passive whisker stimulation lasted longer and spread further across the barrel cortex in awake mice compared to anesthetized mice. Passively evoked sensory responses were large during behaviorally quiet periods and small during active whisking. However, as an exploring mouse approached an object while whisking, large-amplitude, propagating cortical sensory activity was evoked by active whisker-touch. These experiments demonstrate that fiber optics can be used to image cortical sensory activity with high resolution in freely moving animals. The results demonstrate differential processing of sensory input depending upon behavior.},

	abstract = {Glass micropipettes were used to record the activity of 124 single units in the somatosensory vibrissa cortex (SI) of 16 rats in response to combined deflections of contralateral vibrissae. Compact multiangular electromechanical stimulators were used to stimulate individual vibrissal hairs alone or in combinations of two or three adjacent whiskers. Each whisker was stimulated independently to produce controlled temporal and spatial patterns of mechanical stimuli. Following displacement of a vibrissa, unit discharges to subsequent deflections of adjacent whiskers are reduced in a time-dependent fashion. Response suppression is strongest at short interdeflection intervals, i.e., 10-20 ms and decreases progressively during the 50-100 ms following the first deflection. In many cases this period also corresponds with a reduction in ongoing unit discharges. Response suppression was not observed for first-order neurons recorded in the trigeminal ganglion of barbiturate-anesthetized rats. In the cortex, the presence and/or degree of response suppression depends on a number of spatial factors. These include 1) the angular direction(s) in which the individual hairs are moved, 2) the sequence in which two whiskers are deflected, that is, which one is deflected first, 3) the particular combination of whiskers stimulated, and 4) the number (2 or 3) of vibrissae comprising the multiwhisker stimulus. Within a vertical electrode penetration, one particular whisker typically elicits the strongest excitatory and inhibitory effects; other, nearby vibrissae elicit variable (or no) excitation or inhibition. Excitatory and inhibitory subregions of a receptive field could thus be distributed asymmetrically around the maximally effective whisker. In these cases, the receptive fields displayed spatial orientations. Quantitative criteria were used to classify 30 cortical units on the basis of the distribution of inhibitory subregions on either side of the maximally effective whisker. Twenty-one of these cells had receptive fields (RFs) with symmetrical inhibitory side regions. Responses of the other nine units were strongly suppressed by a preceding deflection of a vibrissa on one side but relatively unaffected, or even slightly facilitated, by preceding deflection of the whisker on the other side.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Neocortex, the neuronal structure at the base of the remarkable cognitive skills of mammals, is a layered sheet of neuronal tissue composed of juxtaposed and interconnected columns. A cortical column is considered the basic module of cortical processing present in all cortical areas. It is believed to contain a characteristic microcircuit composed of a few thousand neurons. The high degree of cortical segmentation into vertical columns and horizontal layers is a boon for scientific investigation because it eases the systematic dissection and functional analysis of intrinsic as well as extrinsic connections of the column. In this review we will argue that in order to understand neocortical function one needs to combine a microscopic view, elucidating the workings of the local columnar microcircuits, with a macroscopic view, which keeps track of the linkage of distant cortical modules in different behavioral contexts. We will exemplify this strategy using the model system of vibrissal touch in mice and rats. On the macroscopic level vibrissal touch is an important sense for the subterranean rodents and has been honed by evolution to serve an array of distinct behaviors. Importantly, the vibrissae are moved actively to touch – requiring intricate sensorimotor interactions. Vibrissal touch, therefore, offers ample opportunities to relate different behavioral contexts to specific interactions of distant columns. On the microscopic level, the cortical modules in primary somatosensory cortex process touch inputs at highest magnification and discreteness – each whisker is represented by its own so-called barrel column. The cellular composition, intrinsic connectivity and functional aspects of the barrel column have been studied in great detail. Building on the versatility of genetic tools available in rodents, new, highly selective and flexible cellular and molecular tools to monitor and manipulate neuronal activity have been devised. Researchers have started to combine these with advanced and highly precise behavioral methods, on par with the precision known from monkey preparations. Therefore, the vibrissal touch model system is exquisitely positioned to combine the microscopic with the macroscopic view and promises to be instrumental in our understanding of neocortical function.},

Here, we investigated the synaptically driven membrane potential dynamics during active whisker sensation using whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex of behaving mice. Although whisker contact with an object evoked rapid depolarization in all neurons, these touch responses only drove action potentials in ∼10\% of the cells. Such sparse coding was ensured by cell-specific reversal potentials of the touch-evoked response that were hyperpolarized relative to action potential threshold for most neurons. Intercontact interval profoundly influenced touch-evoked postsynaptic potentials, interestingly without affecting the peak membrane potential of the touch response. Dual whole-cell recordings indicated highly correlated membrane potential dynamics during active touch. Sparse action potential firing within synchronized cortical layer 2/3 microcircuits therefore appears to robustly signal each active touch response.},

	abstract = {Several theoretical, computational, and experimental studies suggest that neurons encode sensory information using a small number of active neurons at any given point in time. This strategy, referred to as ‘sparse coding’, could possibly confer several advantages. First, it allows for increased storage capacity in associative memories; second, it makes the structure in natural signals explicit; third, it represents complex data in a way that is easier to read out at subsequent levels of processing; and fourth, it saves energy. Recent physiological recordings from sensory neurons have indicated that sparse coding could be a ubiquitous strategy employed in several different modalities across different organisms.},

Recent developments in optogenetics have addressed this need, opening up new possibilities for systems neuroscience. Interrogation of even deep neural circuits can be conducted by directly probing the necessity and sufficiency of defined circuit elements with millisecond-scale, cell type-specific optical perturbations, coupled with suitable readouts such as electrophysiology, optical circuit dynamics measures and freely moving behavior in mammals. Here we collect in detail our strategies for delivering microbial opsin genes to deep mammalian brain structures in vivo, along with protocols for integrating the resulting optical control with compatible readouts (electrophysiological, optical and behavioral). The procedures described here, from initial virus preparation to systems-level functional readout, can be completed within 4–5 weeks. Together, these methods may help in providing circuit-level insight into the dynamics underlying complex mammalian behaviors in health and disease.},

	abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common type of epilepsy in adults, is often medically refractory, and due to broad actions and long-time scales, current systemic treatments have major negative side-effects. However, temporal lobe seizures tend to arise from discrete regions before overt clinical behaviour, making temporally and spatially specific treatment theoretically possible. Here we report the arrest of spontaneous seizures using a real-time, closed-loop, response system and in vivo optogenetics in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Either optogenetic inhibition of excitatory principal cells, or activation of a subpopulation of GABAergic cells representing {\textless}5\% of hippocampal neurons, stops seizures rapidly upon light application. These results demonstrate that spontaneous temporal lobe seizures can be detected and terminated by modulating specific cell populations in a spatially restricted manner. A clinical approach built on these principles may overcome many of the side-effects of currently available treatment options.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal oscillations are critical for information processing, and are strongly influenced by inputs from the medial septum. Hippocamposeptal neurons provide direct inhibitory feedback from the hippocampus onto septal cells, and are therefore likely to also play an important role in the circuit; these neurons fire at either low or high frequency, reflecting hippocampal network activity during theta oscillations or ripple events, respectively. Here, we optogenetically target the long-range GABAergic projection from the hippocampus to the medial septum in rats, and thereby simulate hippocampal input onto downstream septal cells in an acute slice preparation. In response to optogenetic activation of hippocamposeptal fibers at theta and ripple frequencies, we elicit postsynaptic GABAergic responses in a subset (24\%) of septal cells, most predominantly in fast-spiking cells. In addition, in another subset of septal cells (19\%) corresponding primarily to cholinergic cells, we observe a slow hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and a decrease in input resistance, particularly in response to prolonged high-frequency (ripple range) stimulation. This slow response is partially sensitive to GIRK channel and D2 dopamine receptor block. Our results suggest that two independent populations of septal cells distinctly encode hippocampal feedback, enabling the septum to monitor ongoing patterns of activity in the hippocampus.},

Now, using optogenetic stimulation of basolateral amygdala terminals in the central nucleus of the amygdala of rats, a specific circuit for natural bidirectional anxiety control has been identified. Stimulating these neurons has a calming effect, whereas blocking the same projection increases anxiety-related behaviours. These findings are consistent with a role for the central nucleus of the amygdala in anxiety, although there may be other circuits working in parallel or downstream of the amygdala.},

Here, we review in vivo chronic extracellular recording studies and recent long-term two-photon calcium-imaging investigations that address the question of stability and plasticity of neuronal population activity in the mammalian brain. Overall, spiking activity is heterogeneously distributed among neurons in local populations and largely remains stable for individual cells over time. Tuning properties appear more flexible and may be adaptively stabilized, possibly by neuromodulators, to encode reliably and specifically salient stimuli or behaviors.},

During whisker stimulation, complex spikes recorded intracellularly from distal dendrites and sharp waves in the electrocorticogram were accompanied by large dendritic [Ca2+] transients; these also occurred during bursts of action potentials recorded from somata of identified layer 5 neurons. The amplitude of the [Ca2+] transients was largest proximal to the main bifurcation, where sodium action potentials produced little Ca2+ influx.

Previous attempts to use membrane-permeant forms of fluorometric calcium indicators to load populations of neurons have yielded satisfactory results only in cell cultures or in slices of immature brain tissue. Here we introduce a versatile approach for loading membrane-permeant fluorescent indicator dyes in large populations of cells. We established a pressure ejection-based local dye delivery protocol that can be used for a large spectrum of membrane-permeant indicator dyes, including calcium green-1 acetoxymethyl (AM) ester, Fura-2 AM, Fluo-4 AM, and Indo-1 AM. We applied this dye-loading protocol successfully in mouse brain tissue at any developmental stage from newborn to adult in vivo and in vitro. In vivo two-photon Ca2+ recordings, obtained by imaging through the intact skull, indicated that whisker deflection-evoked Ca2+ transients occur in a subset of layer 2/3 neurons of the barrel cortex. Thus, our results demonstrate the suitability of this technique for real-time analyses of intact neuronal circuits with the resolution of individual cells.},

Using a chronically implanted glass microprism in barrel cortex, we could image the same fluorescently labeled deep-layer pyramidal neurons across their entire somatodendritic axis for several months. We could also image visually evoked and endogenous calcium activity in hundreds of cell bodies or long-range axon terminals, across all six layers in visual cortex of awake mice. Electrophysiology and calcium imaging of evoked and endogenous activity near the prism face were consistent across days and comparable with previous observations. These experiments extend the reach of in vivo two-photon imaging to chronic, simultaneous monitoring of entire cortical columns.

While most APs were detected under optimal conditions, under conditions typical of population imaging studies, only a minority of 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected (often {\textless}10\% and {\textasciitilde}20–30\%, respectively), emphasizing the limits of AP detection under more realistic imaging conditions.},

	abstract = {Calcium imaging with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) is routinely used to measure neural activity in intact nervous systems. GECIs are frequently used in one of two different modes: to track activity in large populations of neuronal cell bodies, or to follow dynamics in subcellular compartments such as axons, dendrites and individual synaptic compartments. Despite major advances, calcium imaging is still limited by the biophysical properties of existing GECIs, including affinity, signal-to-noise ratio, rise and decay kinetics and dynamic range. Using structure-guided mutagenesis and neuron-based screening, we optimized the green fluorescent protein-based GECI GCaMP6 for different modes of in vivo imaging. The resulting jGCaMP7 sensors provide improved detection of individual spikes (jGCaMP7s,f), imaging in neurites and neuropil (jGCaMP7b), and may allow tracking larger populations of neurons using two-photon (jGCaMP7s,f) or wide-field (jGCaMP7c) imaging.},

Modern fluorescence microscopy provides the basis for such activity mapping, through multi-photon imaging and other optical schemes. Probes remain the rate-limiting step for progress in this field: they should be bright and photostable, and ideally come in multiple colors. Only protein-based reagents permit chronic imaging from genetically specified cells.

Current theory predicts that gamma oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, with the resulting rhythmic inhibition producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation. We causally tested these hypotheses in barrel cortex in vivo by targeting optogenetic manipulation selectively to fast-spiking interneurons. Here we show that light-driven activation of fast-spiking interneurons at varied frequencies (8-200 Hz) selectively amplifies gamma oscillations. In contrast, pyramidal neuron activation amplifies only lower frequency oscillations, a cell-type-specific double dissociation. We found that the timing of a sensory input relative to a gamma cycle determined the amplitude and precision of evoked responses. Our data directly support the fast-spiking-gamma hypothesis and provide the first causal evidence that distinct network activity states can be induced in vivo by cell-type-specific activation.},

It is commonly assumed that the brain constructs its percept of the visual scene from information encoded in the selective responses of such neurons. We have now tested this hypothesis directly by measuring the effect on psychophysical performance of modifying the firing rates of physiologically characterized neurons. We required rhesus monkeys to report the direction of motion in a visual display while we electrically stimulated clusters of directionally selective neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT, or V5), an extrastriate area that plays a prominent role in the analysis of visual motion information1–8. Microstimulation biased the animals' judgements towards the direction of motion encoded by the stimulated neurons. This result indicates that physiological properties measured at the neuronal level can be causally related to a specific aspect of perceptual performance.},

Recordings were remarkably stable and it was therefore possible to obtain whole-cell recordings in awake, head-fixed animals. The whole-cell configuration permitted rapid dialysis of cells with a calcium buffer. In most neurons very little ongoing action potential (AP) activity was observed and the spontaneous firing rates were up to 50-fold less than what has been reported by extracellular unit recordings. AP firing in the brain might therefore be far sparser than previously thought.},

	abstract = {In the mammalian brain, many thousands of single-neuron recording studies have been performed but less than 10 single-cell stimulation studies. This paucity of single-cell stimulation data reflects a lack of easily applicable single-cell stimulation techniques. We provide a detailed description of the procedures involved in nanostimulation, a single-cell stimulation method derived from the juxtacellular labeling technique. Nanostimulation is easy to apply and can be directed to a wide variety of identifiable neurons in anesthetized and awake animals. We describe the recording approach and the parameters of the electric configuration underlying nanostimulation. We use glass pipettes with a DC resistance of 4-7 Mohms. Obtaining the juxtacellular configuration requires a close contact between pipette tip and neuron and is associated with a several-fold increase in resistance to values {\textgreater} or = 20 Mohms. The recorded action potential (AP) amplitude grows to {\textgreater} or = 2 mV, and neurons can be activated with currents in the nanoampere range--hence the term nanostimulation. While exact AP timing has not been achieved, AP frequency and AP number can be parametrically controlled. We demonstrate that nanostimulation can also be used to selectively inhibit sensory responses in identifiable neurons. Nanostimulation is biophysically similar to electroporation, and based on this assumption, we argue that nanostimulation operates on membranes in the micrometer area directly below the pipette tip, where membrane pores are induced by high transmembrane voltage. There is strong evidence to suggest that nanostimulation selectively activates single neurons and that the evoked effects are cell-specific. Nanostimulation therefore holds great potential for elucidating how single neurons contribute to behavior.},

Early single-neuron recording research treated spike pattern variability as noise that needed to be averaged out to reveal the brain's representation of invariant input. Another view is that variability of spikes is centrally coordinated and that this brain-generated ensemble pattern in cortical structures is itself a potential source of cognition. Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work. Achieving the full potential of massively parallel neuronal recordings, however, will require further development of the neuron–electrode interface, automated and efficient spike-sorting algorithms for effective isolation and identification of single neurons, and new mathematical insights for the analysis of network properties.},

Here we review recent progress in understanding how these correlations affect population information, how information should be quantified, and what mechanisms may give rise to correlations. As population coding theory has improved, it has made clear that some forms of correlation are more important for information than others. We argue that this is a critical lesson for those interested in neuronal population responses more generally: Descriptions of population responses should be motivated by and linked to well-specified function.

Thus, although many spatiotemporal features of neural population activity, or "neural codes," have been shown to carry sensory information, it is often unknown whether the brain uses these features for perception. To address this issue, we propose a new framework centered on redefining the neural code as the neural features that carry sensory information used by the animal to drive appropriate behavior; that is, the features that have an intersection between sensory and choice information. We show how this framework leads to a new statistical analysis of neural activity recorded during behavior that can identify such neural codes, and we discuss how to combine intersection-based analysis of neural recordings with intervention on neural activity to determine definitively whether specific neural activity features are involved in a task.},

It is unclear, however, how the results obtained from dimensionality reduction generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials or how these results relate to the underlying network structure. We address these questions by applying factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and to spiking network models that self-generate irregular activity through a balance of excitation and inhibition. We compared the scaling trends of two key outputs of dimensionality reduction—shared dimensionality and percent shared variance—with neuron and trial count. We found that the scaling properties of networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and that the in vivo recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. Furthermore, recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. These findings can help guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling and help relate these outputs to the underlying network structure.},

	abstract = {We compared the ability of psychophysical observers and single cortical neurons to discriminate weak motion signals in a stochastic visual display. All data were obtained from rhesus monkeys trained to perform a direction discrimination task near psychophysical threshold. The conditions for such a comparison were ideal in that both psychophysical and physiological data were obtained in the same animals, on the same sets of trials, and using the same visual display. In addition, the psychophysical task was tailored in each experiment to the physiological properties of the neuron under study; the visual display was matched to each neuron's preference for size, speed, and direction of motion. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of most MT neurons was very similar to the psychophysical sensitivity of the animal observers. In fact, the responses of single neurons typically provided a satisfactory account of both absolute psychophysical threshold and the shape of the psychometric function relating performance to the strength of the motion signal. Thus, psychophysical decisions in our task are likely to be based upon a relatively small number of neural signals. These signals could be carried by a small number of neurons if the responses of the pooled neurons are statistically independent. Alternatively, the signals may be carried by a much larger pool of neurons if their responses are partially intercorrelated.},

To address this issue, mice were trained to report optogenetic stimulations to obtain rewards and avoid punishments. It was found that mice could perceive optogenetic manipulations regardless of the brain area modulated, their rewarding effects, or the stimulation of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic cell types. We named this phenomenon optoception.

	abstract = {A single whisker stimulus elicits action potentials in a sparse subset of neurons in somatosensory cortex. The precise contribution of these neurons to the animal's perception of a whisker stimulus is unknown. Here we show that single-cell stimulation in rat barrel cortex of both sexes influences the psychophysical detection of a near-threshold whisker stimulus in a cell type-dependent manner, without affecting false alarm rate. Counterintuitively, stimulation of single fast-spiking putative inhibitory neurons increased detection performance. Single-cell stimulation of putative excitatory neurons failed to change detection performance, except for a small subset of deep-layer neurons that were highly sensitive to whisker stimulation and that had an unexpectedly strong impact on detection performance. These findings indicate that the perceptual impact of excitatory barrel cortical neurons relates to their firing response to whisker stimulation and that strong activity in a single highly sensitive neuron in barrel cortex can already enhance sensory detection. Our data suggest that sensory detection is based on a decoding mechanism that lends a disproportionally large weight to interneurons and to deep-layer neurons showing a strong response to sensory stimulation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Rat whisker somatosensory cortex contains a variety of neuronal cell types with distinct anatomical and physiological characteristics. How each of these different cell types contribute to the animal's perception of whisker stimuli is unknown. We explored this question by using a powerful electrophysiological stimulation technique that allowed us to target and stimulate single neurons with different sensory response types in whisker cortex. In awake, behaving animals, trained to detect whisker stimulation, only costimulation of single fast-spiking inhibitory neurons or single deep-layer excitatory neurons with strong responses to whisker stimulation enhanced detection performance. Our data demonstrate that single cortical neurons can have measurable impact on the detection of sensory stimuli and suggest a decoding mechanism based on select cell types.},

A variety of probabilistic classification tasks probe the covert strategies that humans use to decide among alternatives based on evidence that bears only probabilistically on outcome. Here we show that rhesus monkeys can also achieve such reasoning. We have trained two monkeys to choose between a pair of coloured targets after viewing four shapes, shown sequentially, that governed the probability that one of the targets would furnish reward. Monkeys learned to combine probabilistic information from the shape combinations.

	abstract = {Simple cells in the primary visual cortex often appear to compute a weighted sum of the light intensity distribution of the visual stimuli that fall on their receptive fields. A linear model of these cells has the advantage of simplicity and captures a number of basic aspects of cell function. It, however, fails to account for important response nonlinearities, such as the decrease in response gain and latency observed at high contrasts and the effects of masking by stimuli that fail to elicit responses when presented alone. To account for these nonlinearities we have proposed a normalization model, which extends the linear model to include mutual shunting inhibition among a large number of cortical cells. Shunting inhibition is divisive, and its effect in the model is to normalize the linear responses by a measure of stimulus energy. To test this model we performed extracellular recordings of simple cells in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques. We presented large stimulus sets consisting of (1) drifting gratings of various orientations and spatiotemporal frequencies; (2) plaids composed of two drifting gratings; and (3) gratings masked by full-screen spatiotemporal white noise. We derived expressions for the model predictions and fitted them to the physiological data. Our results support the normalization model, which accounts for both the linear and the nonlinear properties of the cells. An alternative model, in which the linear responses are subject to a compressive nonlinearity, did not perform nearly as well.},

	abstract = {The nature and origin of the temporal irregularity in the electrical activity of cortical neurons in vivo are not well understood. We consider the hypothesis that this irregularity is due to a balance of excitatory and inhibitory currents into the cortical cells. We study a network model with excitatory and inhibitory populations of simple binary units. The internal feedback is mediated by relatively large synaptic strengths, so that the magnitude of the total excitatory and inhibitory feedback is much larger than the neuronal threshold. The connectivity is random and sparse. The mean number of connections per unit is large, though small compared to the total number of cells in the network. The network also receives a large, temporally regular input from external sources. We present an analytical solution of the mean-field theory of this model, which is exact in the limit of large network size. This theory reveals a new cooperative stationary state of large networks, which we term a balanced state. In this state, a balance between the excitatory and inhibitory inputs emerges dynamically for a wide range of parameters, resulting in a net input whose temporal fluctuations are of the same order as its mean. The internal synaptic inputs act as a strong negative feedback, which linearizes the population responses to the external drive despite the strong nonlinearity of the individual cells. This feedback also greatly stabilizes the system's state and enables it to track a time-dependent input on time scales much shorter than the time constant of a single cell. The spatiotemporal statistics of the balanced state are calculated. It is shown that the autocorrelations decay on a short time scale, yielding an approximate Poissonian temporal statistics. The activity levels of single cells are broadly distributed, and their distribution exhibits a skewed shape with a long power-law tail. The chaotic nature of the balanced state is revealed by showing that the evolution of the microscopic state of the network is extremely sensitive to small deviations in its initial conditions. The balanced state generated by the sparse, strong connections is an asynchronous chaotic state. It is accompanied by weak spatial cross-correlations, the strength of which vanishes in the limit of large network size. This is in contrast to the synchronized chaotic states exhibited by more conventional network models with high connectivity of weak synapses.},

	abstract = {The nature and origin of the temporal irregularity in the electrical activity of cortical neurons in vivo are not well understood. We consider the hypothesis that this irregularity is due to a balance of excitatory and inhibitory currents into the cortical cells. We study a network model with excitatory and inhibitory populations of simple binary units. The internal feedback is mediated by relatively large synaptic strengths, so that the magnitude of the total excitatory and inhibitory feedback is much larger than the neuronal threshold. The connectivity is random and sparse. The mean number of connections per unit is large, though small compared to the total number of cells in the network. The network also receives a large, temporally regular input from external sources. We present an analytical solution of the mean-field theory of this model, which is exact in the limit of large network size. This theory reveals a new cooperative stationary state of large networks, which we term a balanced state. In this state, a balance between the excitatory and inhibitory inputs emerges dynamically for a wide range of parameters, resulting in a net input whose temporal fluctuations are of the same order as its mean. The internal synaptic inputs act as a strong negative feedback, which linearizes the population responses to the external drive despite the strong nonlinearity of the individual cells. This feedback also greatly stabilizes the system's state and enables it to track a time-dependent input on time scales much shorter than the time constant of a single cell. The spatiotemporal statistics of the balanced state are calculated. It is shown that the autocorrelations decay on a short time scale, yielding an approximate Poissonian temporal statistics. The activity levels of single cells are broadly distributed, and their distribution exhibits a skewed shape with a long power-law tail. The chaotic nature of the balanced state is revealed by showing that the evolution of the microscopic state of the network is extremely sensitive to small deviations in its initial conditions. The balanced state generated by the sparse, strong connections is an asynchronous chaotic state. It is accompanied by weak spatial cross-correlations, the strength of which vanishes in the limit of large network size. This is in contrast to the synchronized chaotic states exhibited by more conventional network models with high connectivity of weak synapses.},

	abstract = {Correlations among neurons can affect both the amount of information encoded in a population and strategies for decoding the population. These two issues — encoding and decoding — lead to complementary perspectives about the role of correlations.In the encoding perspective, the information encoded in a population of correlated neurons is compared with the information that would be encoded if the population were uncorrelated.In the decoding perspective, the amount of information lost if correlations are ignored when decoding is measured. Note that the decoding perspective is much more subtle than the encoding perspective — it asks whether a potentially suboptimal strategy, ignoring correlations, really is suboptimal, and, if so, just how bad it is.If we knew only that neural responses were correlated, we would not know whether or not those correlations affected information encoding, nor would we know whether or not they affected decoding strategies. Furthermore, correlations can increase, decrease or not affect the amount of information encoded, just as they can affect or not affect the amount of information extracted using a decoder that ignores correlations.As a corollary to the previous point, the information present in neural responses, as well as the change in information due to attentional or learning-related factors, cannot be estimated by single neuron recordings.At the level of pairs of neurons, the measured effects of correlations on encoding and decoding have been small (in all but one study less than ∼10\%) across many brain areas and species.Correlations can have a large effect at the population level even when they have a small effect at the level of pairs. Consequently, results obtained for pairs of neurons cannot be directly extrapolated to populations, a fact that is true for both encoding and decoding.},

	abstract = {The sensation of flutter is produced when mechanical vibrations in the range of 5-50Hz are applied to the skin. A flutter stimulus activates neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) that somatotopically map to the site of stimulation. A subset of these neurons-those with quickly adapting properties, associated with Meissner's corpuscles-are strongly entrained by periodic flutter vibrations, firing with a probability that oscillates at the input frequency. Hence, quickly adapting neurons provide a dynamic representation of such flutter stimuli. However, are these neurons directly involved in the perception of flutter? Here we investigate this in monkeys trained to discriminate the difference in frequency between two flutter stimuli delivered sequentially on the fingertips. Microelectrodes were inserted into area 3b of S1 and the second stimulus was substituted with a train of injected current pulses. Animals reliably indicated whether the frequency of the second (electrical) signal was higher or lower than that of the first (mechanical) signal, even though both frequencies changed from trial to trial. Almost identical results were obtained with periodic and aperiodic stimuli of equal average frequencies. Thus, the quickly adapting neurons in area 3b activate the circuit leading to the perception of flutter. Furthermore, as far as can be psychophysically quantified during discrimination, the neural code underlying the sensation of flutter can be finely manipulated, to the extent that the behavioural responses produced by natural and artificial stimuli are indistinguishable.},

Here, we examined the effects of spike train irregularity, spike frequency, and spike number on the detectability of single-neuron stimulation in rat somatosensory cortex. For regular-spiking, putative excitatory neurons, detectability increased with spike train irregularity and decreasing spike frequencies but was not affected by spike number. Stimulation of single, fast-spiking, putative inhibitory neurons led to a larger sensory effect compared to regular-spiking neurons, and the effect size depended only on spike irregularity. An ideal-observer analysis suggests that, under our experimental conditions, rats were using integration windows of a few hundred milliseconds or more. Our data imply that the behaving animal is sensitive to single neurons' spikes and even to their temporal patterning.},

	abstract = {Studies on the visual thalamic relays, the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar, provide three key properties that have dramatically changed the view that the thalamus serves as a simple relay to get information from subcortical sites to cortex. First, the retinal input, although a small minority (7\%) in terms of numbers of synapses onto geniculate relay cells, dominates receptive field properties of these relay cells and strongly drives them; 93\% of input thus is nonretinal and modulates the relay in dynamic and important ways related to behavioral state, including attention. We call the retinal input the driver input and the nonretinal, modulator input, and their unique morphological and functional differences allow us to recognize driver and modulator input to many other thalamic relays. Second, much of the modulation is related to control of a voltage-gated, low threshold Ca(2+) conductance that determines response properties of relay cells -burst or tonic - and this, among other things, affects the salience of information relayed. Third, the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar (a massive but generally mysterious and ignored thalamic relay), are examples of two different types of relay: the LGN is a first order relay, transmitting information from a subcortical driver source (retina), while the pulvinar is mostly a higher order relay, transmitting information from a driver source emanating from layer 5 of one cortical area to another area. Higher order relays seem especially important to general corticocortical communication, and this view challenges the conventional dogma that such communication is based on direct corticocortical connections. In this sense, any new information reaching a cortical area, whether from a subcortical source or another cortical area, benefits from a thalamic relay. Other examples of first and higher order relays also exist, and generally higher order relays represent the majority of thalamus. A final property of interest emphasized in chapter 17 by Guillery (2005) is that most or all driver inputs to thalamus, whether from a subcortical source or from layer 5 of cortex, are axons that branch, with the extrathalamic branch innervating a motor or premotor region in the brainstem, or in some cases, spinal cord. This suggests that actual information relayed by thalamus to cortex is actually a copy of motor instructions (Guillery, 2005). Overall, these features of thalamic relays indicate that the thalamus not only provides a behaviorally relevant, dynamic control over the nature of information relayed, it also plays a key role in basic corticocortical communication.},

One of the major functions of the thalamus is the selective control of the flow of sensory-motor information to the cerebral cortex during different states of the sleep-wake cycle and arousal, and is controlled through the actions of various neurotransmitter systems in the brainstem, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex. Recent investigations have detailed the cellular mechanisms, including the role of GABAA and GABAB receptors, involved in the generation of both normal (e.g. spindle waves) and abnormal (e.g. generalized seizures) patterns of activity in thalamocortical circuits. In addition, in vivo investigations have also revealed that the dense projection from the cerebral cortex to the thalamus may synchronize thalamocortical activity in a manner useful for sensory analysis. Together, these data suggest that oscillations and synchronization are important for both normal and abnormal function in thalamocortical circuits.},

This study examined whether the variability can be attributed to ongoing activity. Ongoing and evoked spatiotemporal activity patterns in the cat visual cortex were measured with real-time optical imaging; local field potentials and discharges of single neurons were recorded simultaneously, by electrophysiological techniques. The evoked activity appeared deterministic, and the variability resulted from the dynamics of ongoing activity, presumably reflecting the instantaneous state of cortical networks. In spite of the large variability, evoked responses in single trials could be predicted by linear summation of the deterministic response and the preceding ongoing activity. Ongoing activity must play an important role in cortical function and cannot be ignored in exploration of cognitive processes.},

This dense, homotypical patch of labeled cells was usually surrounded by a less densely populated fringe of labeled cells that bordered, but did not appear to enter, heterotypical zones. In two animals, however, some retrogradely labeled cells were found in the cortex representing somatotopic zones adjacent to the sites injected with horseradish peroxidase. These results indicated that somatosensory area II primarily sends homotypical projections to somatosensory area I.

By combining whole-cell recording from identified L6 principal cells in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) with modified rabies virus-based input mapping, we have determined the sensory response properties and upstream monosynaptic connectivity of cells mediating the CC or CT pathway. We show that CC-projecting cells encompass a broad spectrum of selectivity to stimulus orientation and are predominantly innervated by deep layer V1 neurons. In contrast, CT-projecting cells are ultrasparse firing, exquisitely tuned to orientation and direction information, and receive long-range input from higher cortical areas. This segregation in function and connectivity indicates that L6 microcircuits route specific contextual and stimulus-related information within and outside the cortical network.},

Previous studies demonstrate two L5 pyramid types: cortico-cortical (CC) and cortico-subcortical (CS).

Unlike previously described L5 CC and CS neurons, this new subtype does not project to striatum [cortico-cortical, non-striatal (CC-NS)] and has distinct morphology, physiology, and visual responses. Monosynaptic rabies tracing reveals that CC neurons preferentially receive input from higher visual areas, while CS neurons receive more input from structures implicated in top-down modulation of brain states. CS neurons are also more direction-selective and prefer faster stimuli than CC neurons. These differences suggest distinct roles as specialized output channels, with CS neurons integrating information and generating responses more relevant to movement control and CC neurons being more important in visual perception.},

This diversity suggests that individual inhibitory classes have unique roles in cortical circuits; however, their characterization to date has been limited to broad classifications including many subtypes. We used the Cre/LoxP system, specifically labeling parvalbumin(PV)-expressing interneurons in visual cortex of PV-Cre mice with red fluorescent protein (RFP), followed by targeted loose-patch recordings and two-photon imaging of calcium responses in vivo to characterize the visual receptive field properties of these cells. Despite their relative molecular and morphological homogeneity, we find that PV+ neurons have a diversity of feature-specific visual responses that include sharp orientation and direction-selectivity, small receptive fields, and band-pass spatial frequency tuning. These results suggest that subsets of parvalbumin interneurons are components of specific cortical networks and that perisomatic inhibition contributes to the generation of precise response properties.},

How different types of neuron form and how axons can project over long distances and make highly specific contacts to establish a functional circuit remain largely unknown.We provide an overview of the spatial and temporal sequence of how neuronal diversification emerges in the sensory neuron lineage and how it is genetically coordinated with other developmental processes during the same period of development.We outline the relationship between the gene programmes driving multipotency, neurogenesis and sensory specification and discuss the relation of transcription factors to sensory subtype diversification.This review illustrates how, during development, one transcription factor can coordinate different developmental processes necessary for building a functional circuit.In many parts of the nervous system, neuronal subtypes are produced before precise and unique connection patterns exist. Recent data on the runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) family of transcription factors give an example of how, in a context-dependent manner, RUNX1 and RUNX3 drive key aspects of the establishment of the nociceptive, mechanoreceptive and proprioceptive subclasses of sensory neuron, from identity to modality-specific contact characteristics.RUNX transcription factors act both as transcriptional repressors and activators at different times in development, driving the expression of genes that molecularly and functionally characterize different subtypes of sensory neuron.We also discuss how these transcription factors might be acting cell-autonomously to affect neuronal propensity for axonal growth and susceptibility to cell death.},

What are the neuronal mechanisms that enable conscious perception? Why do some images remain subliminal? Van Vugt et al. trained monkeys to detect low-contrast images and compared neuronal activity in brain areas V1, V4, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Some stimuli made it into consciousness, and others were subliminal depending on their propagation, which can be variable for weak stimuli (see the Perspective by Mashour). Strongly propagated stimuli initiated a state in the higher brain areas called “ignition” that caused information about a brief stimulus to become sustained and broadcasted back through recurrent interactions between many brain areas.
Science, this issue p. 537; see also p. 493
Why are some visual stimuli consciously detected, whereas others remain subliminal? We investigated the fate of weak visual stimuli in the visual and frontal cortex of awake monkeys trained to report stimulus presence. Reported stimuli were associated with strong sustained activity in the frontal cortex, and frontal activity was weaker and quickly decayed for unreported stimuli. Information about weak stimuli could be lost at successive stages en route from the visual to the frontal cortex, and these propagation failures were confirmed through microstimulation of area V1. Fluctuations in response bias and sensitivity during perception of identical stimuli were traced back to prestimulus brain-state markers. A model in which stimuli become consciously reportable when they elicit a nonlinear ignition process in higher cortical areas explained our results.
Weak stimuli reach conscious perception only if they are propagated well enough to cross a threshold in higher cortical areas.

The high level of centrality of brain hubs also renders them points of vulnerability that are susceptible to disconnection and dysfunction in brain disorders.

For instance, visual processing in primates requires the appropriate relaying of signals across many distinct cortical areas. Yet our understanding of how populations of neurons in interconnected brain areas communicate is in its infancy. Here we investigate how trial-to-trial ﬂuctuations of population responses in primary visual cortex (V1) are related to simultaneously recorded population responses in area V2. Using dimensionality reduction methods, we ﬁnd that V1-V2 interactions occur through a communication subspace: V2 ﬂuctuations are related to a small subset of V1 population activity patterns, distinct from the largest ﬂuctuations shared among neurons within V1. In contrast, interactions between subpopulations within V1 are less selective. We propose that the communication subspace may be a general, population-level mechanism by which activity can be selectively routed across brain areas.},

	abstract = {A baseline or control state is fundamental to the understanding of
 most complex systems. Defining a baseline state in the human brain,
 arguably our most complex system, poses a particular challenge. Many
 suspect that left unconstrained, its activity will vary unpredictably.
 Despite this prediction we identify a baseline state of the normal
 adult human brain in terms of the brain oxygen extraction fraction or
 OEF. The OEF is defined as the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to
 oxygen delivered by flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the
 awake but resting state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local
 deviations in the OEF represent the physiological basis of signals of
 changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional MRI during a wide
 variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative metabolic and
 circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography to obtain
 the OEF regionally throughout the brain. Areas of activation were
 conspicuous by their absence. All significant deviations from the mean
 hemisphere OEF were increases, signifying deactivations, and resided
 almost exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of
 an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that
 consistently exhibit decreases from this baseline, during a wide
 variety of goal-directed behaviors monitored with positron-emission
 tomography and functional MRI. These decreases suggest the existence of
 an organized, baseline default mode of brain function that is suspended
 during specific goal-directed behaviors.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31\% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40\%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40\%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10\% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment.},

Here we analysed the dimensionality of the encoding of natural images by large populations of neurons in the visual cortex of awake mice. The evoked population activity was high-dimensional, and correlations obeyed an unexpected power law: the nth principal component variance scaled as 1/n. This scaling was not inherited from the power law spectrum of natural images, because it persisted after stimulus whitening. We proved mathematically that if the variance spectrum was to decay more slowly then the population code could not be smooth, allowing small changes in input to dominate population activity. The theory also predicts larger power-law exponents for lower-dimensional stimulus ensembles, which we validated experimentally. These results suggest that coding smoothness may represent a fundamental constraint that determines correlations in neural population codes.},

	abstract = {This article describes how neurons detect rewards, learn to predict future rewards from past experience, and use reward information for learning, choosing, preparing and executing goal-directed behaviour. It also attempts to place the processing of drug rewards within a general framework of neuronal reward mechanisms.Rewards are defined by their action on behaviour, and are crucial for the survival of the organism. They are vital in the control of homeostasis, sustain learning of new behaviours, the induction of approach behaviour and serve as goals for voluntary, intentional behaviour.Various neurons detect the occurrence of rewards and reward-predicting stimuli, including those of the ascending dopamine systems, and neurons within the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala. Some of these neurons seem to provide a reward prediction error signal that could be used for learning mechanisms, whereas others seem to be involved in the perception of individual rewards or objects that signal rewards.Some neurons in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex do not respond directly to rewards but seem to anticipate the occurrence of future rewards. Some neurons process reward information that is dependent on the relative motivational value of the reward.Neurons in the striatum and different areas of frontal and parietal cortex incorporate information about expected rewards into neuronal activity involved in the production of behaviour leading to reward acquisition. They seem to code the goals of behaviour at the time the behaviour towards the goal is being prepared and executed. Some neurons are active before self-initiated, reward-directed movements and adapt their activity according to ongoing experience.These studies show that different aspects of reward functions are processed by different neurons in different brain structures. The optimal use of reward information for learning and controlling behaviour requires cooperation between these neuronal reward signals.The brain structures involved in the processing of natural rewards also seem to be the critical structures for the action of drugs of abuse. One may ask whether such drugs modify existing neuronal responses to natural rewards or constitute rewards in their own right, and as such engage existing neuronal reward mechanisms, directing subjects towards artificially rewarding goals.This research describes the first steps towards an understanding of how rewards influence behaviour before their receipt and how the brain might use reward information to control learning and goal-directed behaviour.},

Elevation, but not reduction, of cellular E/I balance within the mouse medial prefrontal cortex was found to elicit a profound impairment in cellular information processing, associated with specific behavioural impairments and increased high-frequency power in the 30–80 Hz range, which have both been observed in clinical conditions in humans. Consistent with the E/I balance hypothesis, compensatory elevation of inhibitory cell excitability partially rescued social deficits caused by E/I balance elevation.

By precisely titrating the number of neurons stimulated, we demonstrate that the lower bound for perception of cortical activity is {\textasciitilde}14 pyramidal neurons. We find a steep sigmoidal relationship between the number of activated neurons and behaviour, saturating at only {\textasciitilde}37 neurons, and show this relationship can shift with learning. Furthermore, activation of ensembles is balanced by inhibition of neighbouring neurons. This surprising perceptual sensitivity in the face of potent network suppression supports the sparse coding hypothesis, and suggests that cortical perception balances a trade-off between minimizing the impact of noise while efficiently detecting relevant signals.},

In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5-40-µm long).

	abstract = {Neurons are sensitive to the relative timing of inputs, both because several inputs must coincide to reach spike threshold and because active dendritic mechanisms can amplify synchronous inputs. To determine if input synchrony can influence behavior, we trained mice to report activation of excitatory neurons in visual cortex using channelrhodopsin-2. We used light pulses that varied in duration from a few milliseconds to 100 ms and measured neuronal responses and animals’ detection ability. We found detection performance was well predicted by the total amount of light delivered. Short pulses provided no behavioral advantage, even when they concentrated evoked spikes into an interval a few milliseconds long. Arranging pulses into trains of varying frequency from beta to gamma also produced no behavioral advantage. Light intensities required to drive behavior were low (at low intensities, channelrhodopsin-2 conductance varies linearly with intensity), and the accompanying changes in firing rate were small (over 100 ms, average change: 1.1 spikes per s). Firing rate changes varied linearly with pulse intensity and duration, and behavior was predicted by total spike count independent of temporal arrangement. Thus, animals’ detection performance reflected the linear integration of total input over 100 ms. This behavioral linearity despite neurons’ nonlinearities can be explained by a population code using noisy neurons. Ongoing background activity creates probabilistic spiking, allowing weak inputs to change spike probability linearly, with little amplification of coincident input. Summing across a population then yields a total spike count that weights inputs equally, regardless of their arrival time.},

However, the number and identities of neurons microstimulated, as well as the number of action potentials evoked, are difficult to ascertain. To address these issues we introduced the light-gated algal channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) specifically into a small fraction of layer 2/3 neurons of the mouse primary somatosensory cortex. ChR2 photostimulation in vivo reliably generated stimulus-locked action potentials at frequencies up to 50 Hz. Here we show that naive mice readily learned to detect brief trains of action potentials (five light pulses, 1 ms, 20 Hz). After training, mice could detect a photostimulus firing a single action potential in approximately 300 neurons. Even fewer neurons (approximately 60) were required for longer stimuli (five action potentials, 250 ms). Our results show that perceptual decisions and learning can be driven by extremely brief epochs of cortical activity in a sparse subset of supragranular cortical pyramidal neurons.},

Here we describe a method—influence mapping—that uses single-neuron perturbations to directly measure how cortical neurons reshape sensory representations. In layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1), we use two-photon optogenetics to trigger action potentials in a targeted neuron and calcium imaging to measure the effect on spiking in neighbouring neurons in awake mice viewing visual stimuli. Excitatory neurons on average suppressed other neurons and had a centre–surround influence profile over anatomical space. A neuron’s influence on its neighbour depended on their similarity in activity. Notably, neurons suppressed activity in similarly tuned neurons more than in dissimilarly tuned neurons. In addition, photostimulation reduced the population response, specifically to the targeted neuron’s preferred stimulus, by around 2\%. Therefore, V1 layer 2/3 performed feature competition, in which a like-suppresses-like motif reduces redundancy in population activity and may assist with inference of the features that underlie sensory input. We anticipate that influence mapping can be extended to investigate computations in other neural populations.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex, multi-system neurodegenerative disorder. The second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease, it affects approximately 1\% of adults over age 60. Diagnosis follows the development of one or more of the core motor features of the disease, including tremor, slowing of movement (bradykinesia), and rigidity. However, there are numerous other motor and nonmotor disease manifestations. Many PD symptoms result directly from neurodegeneration; others are driven by aberrant activity patterns in surviving neurons. This latter phenomenon, PD circuit dysfunction, is an area of intense study, as it likely underlies our ability to treat many disease symptoms in the face of (currently) irreversible neurodegeneration. This Review will discuss key clinical features of PD and their basis in neural circuit dysfunction. We will first review important disease symptoms and some of the responsible neuropathology. We will then describe the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit, the major locus of PD-related circuit dysfunction, and some of the models that have influenced its study. We will review PD-related changes in network activity, subdividing findings into those that touch on the rate, rhythm, or synchronization of neurons. Finally, we suggest some critical remaining questions for the field and areas for new developments.},

It is unlikely that there is a singular mechanism that applies to all epilepsy syndromes.This concept classically refers to the acquired epilepsies but can be viewed as applicable to at least some genetically determined epilepsies as well.Specific themes have emerged in recent years that may represent points of convergence in the field of epileptogenesis, including abnormal signalling by large-scale molecular cascades such as mammalian target of rapamycin and repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST), the dysfunction of particular neuronal cell types with seeming importance in basic mechanisms of epilepsy and dysfunction of discrete neuronal circuit elements.Seizures are by definition circuit-level phenomena that require the re-entrant activation of embedded loop structures within cortical circuits. The above-mentioned considerations further highlight circuit-level considerations and analysis in our future understanding of epileptogenesis and mechanisms of epilepsy.},

	abstract = {An essential feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in the brain, many years to decades before the onset of overt cognitive symptoms. We suggest that during this very extended early phase of the disease, soluble Aβ oligomers and amyloid plaques alter the function of local neuronal circuits and large-scale networks by disrupting the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) in the brain. The analysis of mouse models of AD revealed that an Aβ-induced change of the E/I balance caused hyperactivity in cortical and hippocampal neurons, a breakdown of slow-wave oscillations, as well as network hypersynchrony. Remarkably, hyperactivity of hippocampal neurons precedes amyloid plaque formation, suggesting that hyperactivity is one of the earliest dysfunctions in the pathophysiological cascade initiated by abnormal Aβ accumulation. Therapeutics that correct the E/I balance in early AD may prevent neuronal dysfunction, widespread cell loss and cognitive impairments associated with later stages of the disease.

In this study, fast voltage-sensitive dye imaging and extracellular and whole-cell electrophysiology were used on entorhinal cortical-hippocampal slice preparations to characterize hippocampal network activity in 12–16 month old female APPswe/PSEN1DeltaE9 (APdE9 mice) mice. Aged APdE9 mice exhibited profound disruptions in dentate gyrus circuit activation. High frequency stimulation of the perforant pathway in the dentate gyrus (DG) area of APdE9 mouse tissue evoked abnormally large field potential responses corresponding to the wider neural activation maps. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of the identified inhibitory interneurons in the molecular layer of DG revealed that they fail to reliably fire action potentials. Taken together, abnormal DG excitability and an inhibitory neuron failure to generate action potentials are suggested to be important contributors to the underlying cellular mechanisms of early-stage Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology.},

Here we show that the gain (or reward) a monkey can expect to realize from an eye-movement response modulates the activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area, an area of primate cortex that is thought to transform visual signals into eye-movement commands. We also show that the activity of these neurons is sensitive to the probability that a particular response will result in a gain. When animals can choose freely between two alternative responses, the choices subjects make and neuronal activation in this area are both correlated with the relative amount of gain that the animal can expect from each response.

In the model, the predicted value of the chosen option is the product of sensory confidence and learned value.

However, only the latter played a causal role: inactivating medial prefrontal cortex before outcome strengthened learning from the outcome. Dopamine neurons played a causal role only after outcome, when they encoded reward prediction errors graded by confidence, influencing subsequent choices.

TS) were observed throughout layers II--VI; "fast" cortical spikes (FS) were less frequently encountered and largely restricted to layer IV. Although both types of potentials had similar negative-positive waveforms. FSs were distinguished from RSs by their comparatively rapid time course, about half that of RSs. RS units (RSU) discharged spontaneously at rates of less than 1--15/s, whereas FS units (FSU) displayed rates of 15--50/s. The amplitudes of FSs, which were generally smaller than those of RSs, often decreased during high-frequency discharges. 3. With sinusoidal oscillations of a vibrissa FSUs responded more reliably and over a broader range of frequencies (3 to at least 40 Hz) than did RSUs , particularly in layer IV. In addition, FSUs typically responded to whisker deflections over a range of 360 degrees, whereas many RSUs in layer IV displayed sharp spatial-tuning charcteristics, responding over a restricted range of less than 90 degrees. 4. Of all units, 58\% responded preferentially to stimulus transients (vibrissal movements), 32\% displayed sustained responses to stimulus stead-states (fixed vibrissal displacement). For the remaining 10\% of units the appropriate stimulus could not be specified; these units were particularly common in layer V. 5. Computation of quantitative stimulus-response relations showed that many units increased their rate of discharge with increasing stimulus intensities. 6. Most units were directionally selective, responding preferentially to deflections of a whisker in one or more of four quadrants. 7. In radial penetrations through the cortex there was a columnar patern so that units were activated at least by the same (i.e., the "principal") whisker. In a number of cases these could be directly correlated with the barrels. Of all units, 55\% responded to deflections of single vibrissa only, the remaining 45\% to 2--12 adjacently situated vibrissae. For most multiple-whiser units the responses elicited by deflection of any one hair activating the neuron was qualitatively similar to those elicited by deflection of any other hair activating it. The principal whisker of the penetration was typically associated with the most vigorous responses. 8. In layer IV, 85\% of neurons responded to deflections of one hair only, the remaining 15\% to two or more hairs. In layers II and III 39\% of units were activated by more than one vibrissa; in layers V and VI multiple-whisker units predominated (64\%).

In the present study, neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) were used as a model to examine how single neurons deal with simultaneous cues from different sensory modalities (e.g., visual, auditory, somatosensory). The functional result of multisensory convergence on an individual cell was determined by comparing the responses evoked from it by a combined-modality (multimodal) stimulus with those elicited by each (unimodal) component of that stimulus presented alone. Superior colliculus cells exhibited profound changes in their activity when individual sensory stimuli were combined. These "multisensory interactions" were found to be widespread among deep laminae cells and fell into one of two functional categories: response enhancement, characterized by a significant increase in the number of discharges evoked; and response depression, characterized by a significant decrease in the discharges elicited. Multisensory response interactions most often reflected a multiplicative, rather than summative, change in activity. Their absolute magnitude varied from cell to cell and, when stimulus conditions were altered, within the same cell. However, the percentage change of enhanced interactions was generally inversely related to the vigor of the responses that could be evoked by presenting each unimodal stimulus alone and suggest that the potential for response amplification was greatest when responses evoked by individual stimuli were weakest. The majority of cells exhibiting multi-sensory characteristics were demonstrated to have descending efferent projections and thus had access to premotor and motor areas of the brain stem and spinal cord involved in SC-mediated attentive and orientation behaviors. These data show that multisensory convergence provides the descending efferent cells of the SC with a dynamic response character. The responses of these cells and the SC-mediated behaviors that they underlie need not be immutably tied to the presence of any single stimulus, but can vary in response to the particular complex of stimuli present in the environment at any given moment.},

	abstract = {Neuron activity across the brain
How is it that groups of neurons dispersed through the brain interact to generate complex behaviors? Three papers in this issue present brain-scale studies of neuronal activity and dynamics (see the Perspective by Huk and Hart). Allen et al. found that in thirsty mice, there is widespread neural activity related to stimuli that elicit licking and drinking. Individual neurons encoded task-specific responses, but every brain area contained neurons with different types of response. Optogenetic stimulation of thirst-sensing neurons in one area of the brain reinstated drinking and neuronal activity across the brain that previously signaled thirst. Gründemann et al. investigated the activity of mouse basal amygdala neurons in relation to behavior during different tasks. Two ensembles of neurons showed orthogonal activity during exploratory and nonexploratory behaviors, possibly reflecting different levels of anxiety experienced in these areas. Stringer et al. analyzed spontaneous neuronal firing, finding that neurons in the primary visual cortex encoded both visual information and motor activity related to facial movements. The variability of neuronal responses to visual stimuli in the primary visual area is mainly related to arousal and reflects the encoding of latent behavioral states.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONIn the absence of sensory inputs, the brain produces structured patterns of activity, which can be as large as or larger than sensory-driven activity. Ongoing activity exists even in primary sensory cortices and has been hypothesized to reflect recapitulation of previous sensory experiences, or expectations of possible sensory events. Alternatively, ongoing activity could be related to behavioral and cognitive states.
RATIONALEMuch previous work has linked spontaneous neural activity to behavior through one-dimensional measures like running speed and pupil diameter. However, mice perform diverse behaviors consisting of whisking, licking, sniffing, and other facial movements. We hypothesized that there exists a multidimensional representation of behavior in visual cortex and that previously reported “noise” during stimulus presentations may in fact be behaviorally driven. To investigate this, we recorded the activity of {\textasciitilde}10,000 neurons in visual cortex of awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging, while simultaneously monitoring the facial movements using an infrared camera. In a second set of experiments, we recorded the activity of thousands of neurons across the brain using eight simultaneous Neuropixels probes, again videographically monitoring facial behavior.
RESULTSFirst, we found that ongoing activity in visual cortex is high dimensional: More than a hundred latent dimensions could be reliably extracted from the population activity. We found that a third of this activity could be predicted by a multidimensional model of the mouse’s behavior, extracted from the face video. This behaviorally related activity was not limited to visual cortex. We observed multidimensional representations of behavior in electrophysiological recordings from frontal, sensorimotor, and retrosplenial cortex; hippocampus; striatum; thalamus; and midbrain. Even though both behavior and neural activity contained fast–time scale fluctuations on the order of 200 ms, they were only related to each other at a time scale of about 1 s. We next investigated how this spontaneous, behavior-related signal interacts with stimulus responses. The representation of sensory stimuli and behavioral variables was mixed in the same neurons: The fractions of each neuron’s variance explained by stimuli and by behavior were only slightly negatively correlated, and neurons with similar stimulus responses did not have more similar behavioral correlates. Nevertheless, at a population level, the neural dimensions encoding motor variables overlapped with those encoding visual stimuli along only one dimension, which coherently increased or decreased the activity of the entire population. Activity in all other behaviorally driven dimensions continued unperturbed regardless of sensory stimulation.
CONCLUSIONThe brainwide representation of behavioral variables suggests that information encoded nearly anywhere in the forebrain is combined with behavioral state variables into a mixed representation. We found that these multidimensional signals are present both during ongoing activity and during passive viewing of a stimulus. This suggests that previously reported noise during stimulus presentations may consist primarily of behavioral-state information. What benefit could this ubiquitous mixing of sensory and motor information provide? The most appropriate behavior for an animal to perform at any moment depends on the combination of available sensory data, ongoing motor actions, and purely internal variables such as motivational drives. Integration of sensory inputs with motor actions must therefore occur somewhere in the nervous system. Our data indicate that it happens as early as primary sensory cortex. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/364/6437/eaav7893/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Large-scale neural population recordings can be predicted from behavior.We used new recording technologies to simultaneously monitor the activity of {\textasciitilde}10,000 neurons in a single brain area and {\textasciitilde}3000 neurons from across the brain (top left). These neurons showed slow–time scale patterns of coactivation restricted to subsets of neurons which were distributed across the brain (top right). The patterns of neural activity appeared to be driven by specific spontaneous behaviors that the animals engaged in during the experiment. We tracked these spontaneous behaviors by projecting a video recording of the mouse face onto a set of canonical “eigenfaces” (bottom left) and used these projections to predict a large fraction of the neural activity (bottom right). t, time; PC, principal component.
Neuronal populations in sensory cortex produce variable responses to sensory stimuli and exhibit intricate spontaneous activity even without external sensory input. Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Recording more than 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we observed that spontaneous activity reliably encoded a high-dimensional latent state, which was partially related to the mouse’s ongoing behavior and was represented not just in visual cortex but also across the forebrain. Sensory inputs did not interrupt this ongoing signal but added onto it a representation of external stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information.
Neurons in the primary visual cortex encode both visual information and motor activity.

In the cortex, synapses are embedded within multilayered networks, making it difficult to determine the effect of an individual synaptic modification on the behaviour of the system. The backpropagation algorithm solves this problem in deep artificial neural networks, but historically it has been viewed as biologically problematic. Nonetheless, recent developments in neuroscience and the successes of artificial neural networks have reinvigorated interest in whether backpropagation offers insights for understanding learning in the cortex. The backpropagation algorithm learns quickly by computing synaptic updates using feedback connections to deliver error signals. Although feedback connections are ubiquitous in the cortex, it is difficult to see how they could deliver the error signals required by strict formulations of backpropagation. Here we build on past and recent developments to argue that feedback connections may instead induce neural activities whose differences can be used to locally approximate these signals and hence drive effective learning in deep networks in the brain.},

A subset of neurons responsible for carrying the residual errors showed endstopping and other extra-classical receptive-field effects.

Here we introduce OnACID, an Online framework for the Analysis of streaming Calcium Imaging Data, including i) motion artifact correction, ii) neuronal source extraction, and iii) activity denoising and deconvolution. Our approach combines and extends previous work on online dictionary learning and calcium imaging data analysis, to deliver an automated pipeline that can discover and track the activity of hundreds of cells in real time, thereby enabling new types of closed-loop experiments. We apply our algorithm on two large scale experimental datasets, benchmark its performance on manually annotated data, and show that it outperforms a popular ofﬂine approach.},

To explore the relevance of each mode of information transmission, we probed the sensitivity of mice to perturbations across each stimulus dimension (i.e., rate, synchrony, and latency) using holographic two-photon optogenetic stimulation of olfactory bulb neurons with cellular and single-action-potential resolution. We found that mice can detect single action potentials evoked synchronously across {\textless}20 olfactory bulb neurons. Further, we discovered that detection depends strongly on the synchrony of activation across neurons, but not the latency relative to inhalation.},

	abstract = {Sensory neurons give highly variable responses to stimulation, which can limit the amount of stimulus information available to downstream circuits. Much work has investigated the factors that affect the amount of information encoded in these population responses, leading to insights about the role of covariability among neurons, tuning curve shape, etc. However, the informativeness of neural responses is not the only relevant feature of population codes; of potentially equal importance is how robustly that information propagates to downstream structures. For instance, to quantify the retina’s performance, one must consider not only the informativeness of the optic nerve responses, but also the amount of information that survives the spike-generating nonlinearity and noise corruption in the next stage of processing, the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our study identifies the set of covariance structures for the upstream cells that optimize the ability of information to propagate through noisy, nonlinear circuits. Within this optimal family are covariances with “differential correlations”, which are known to reduce the information encoded in neural population activities. Thus, covariance structures that maximize information in neural population codes, and those that maximize the ability of this information to propagate, can be very different. Moreover, redundancy is neither necessary nor sufficient to make population codes robust against corruption by noise: redundant codes can be very fragile, and synergistic codes can—in some cases—optimize robustness against noise.},

	abstract = {Trial-to-trial variability can result from both deterministic sources, such as complex dynamics or internal states, and randomness — that is, noise. This Review focuses on noise and its impact along the behavioural loop.Sensory noise is noise in sensory signals and sensory receptors. It limits the amount of information that is available to other areas of the CNS.Cellular noise is an underestimated contributor to neuronal variability. The stochastic nature of neuronal mechanisms becomes critical in the many small structures of the CNS.Electrical noise in neurons, especially channel noise from voltage-gated ion channels, limits neuronal reliability and cell size, producing millisecond variability in action-potential initiation and propagation.Synaptic noise results from the noisy biochemical processes that underlie synaptic transmission. Adding up these noise sources can account for the observed postsynaptic-response variability.Noise build-up in neural networks can be contained by appropriate network layouts, homeostatic mechanisms and the threshold-like nature of neurons.Motor noise results when neural signals are converted into forces. The architecture of motor neurons and their muscle fibres makes the conversion noisy. The brain organizes movements to minimize the effects of motor noise on movement variability.Beneficial effects of noise include stochastic resonance in specific cases of sensory processing and forcing neural networks to be more robust and explore more states.Behavioural variability, as observed in sensory estimation and movement tasks, appears to be mainly produced by noise.The principle of averaging is one of two fundamental principles applied by the CNS to compensate for noise by summing over sources of redundant information.The principle of prior knowledge is the other fundamental principle: it exploits the expected nature of signals and noise. The CNS often applies it in combination with averaging, such as in Bayesian cue combination in sensory processing.},

	abstract = {Chronically implanted microelectrodes have been used to obtain extracellular records of trains of spontaneous action potentials from 30 neurones in the cerebral cortices of 13 unrestrained cats. Recorded neurones were in or near to primary visual cortex, primary auditory cortex, and in the supra-sylvian gyrus. Records were made with animals in several different behavioural states, which included sleep with rapid eye-movements and quiet sleep, peacefully awake, and alarmed. Interval distributions derived from trains of 200 action potentials recorded in less than 80 s did not differ significantly from curves in which the probability of any interval is normally distributed about a modal interval, when plotted on a logarithmic time-axis. Thus the complete interval distributions of neurones firing faster than 2.5/s can be described by two parameters – a modal interval, and a geometric standard deviation. This quantitative description of interval distributions proved equally applicable to neurones in all three cortical areas and was valid over the whole range of behavioural states examined. It does not usually hold when the discharge frequency of a neurone is lower than 2.5 action potentials per second. An acceptable fit for a log-normal curve can then only be obtained for intervals that are shorter than about ten times the modal interval. It is pointed out that mean frequency of discharge is a measure of neural activity which is a secondary parameter, since it is dependent upon both modal interval and geometric standard deviation. Our preliminary data show that the two parameters which define the best-fit log-normal curves can vary independently with the behavioural state of the animal in a way that suggests that they may be physiologically important.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we systematically investigate both the synfire propagation and firing rate propagation in feedforward neuronal network coupled in an all-to-all fashion. In contrast to most earlier work, where only reliable synaptic connections are considered, we mainly examine the effects of unreliable synapses on both types of neural activity propagation in this work. We first study networks composed of purely excitatory neurons. Our results show that both the successful transmission probability and excitatory synaptic strength largely influence the propagation of these two types of neural activities, and better tuning of these synaptic parameters makes the considered network support stable signal propagation. It is also found that noise has significant but different impacts on these two types of propagation. The additive Gaussian white noise has the tendency to reduce the precision of the synfire activity, whereas noise with appropriate intensity can enhance the performance of firing rate propagation. Further simulations indicate that the propagation dynamics of the considered neuronal network is not simply determined by the average amount of received neurotransmitter for each neuron in a time instant, but also largely influenced by the stochastic effect of neurotransmitter release. Second, we compare our results with those obtained in corresponding feedforward neuronal networks connected with reliable synapses but in a random coupling fashion. We confirm that some differences can be observed in these two different feedforward neuronal network models. Finally, we study the signal propagation in feedforward neuronal networks consisting of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and demonstrate that inhibition also plays an important role in signal propagation in the considered networks.},

	abstract = {The classical view of neural coding has emphasized the importance of information carried by the rate at which neurons discharge action potentials. More recent proposals that information may be carried by precise spike timing1,2,3,4,5 have been challenged by the assumption that these neurons operate in a noisy fashion—presumably reflecting fluctuations in synaptic input6—and, thus, incapable of transmitting signals with millisecond fidelity. Here we show that precisely synchronized action potentials can propagate within a model of cortical network activity that recapitulates many of the features of biological systems. An attractor, yielding a stable spiking precision in the (sub)millisecond range, governs the dynamics of synchronization. Our results indicate that a combinatorial neural code, based on rapid associations of groups of neurons co-ordinating their activity at the single spike level, is possible within a cortical-like network.},

This similarity poses an intriguing puzzle: why is psychophysical sensitivity not greater than that of single neurons? Pooling responses across neurons should average out noise in the activity of single cells, leading to substantially improved psychophysical performance. If, however, noise is correlated among these neurons, the beneficial effects of pooling would be diminished10–12. To assess correlation within a pool, the responses of pairs of neurons were recorded simultaneously during repeated stimulus presentations. We report here that the observed covariation in spike count was relatively weak, the correlation coefficient averaging 0.12. A theoretical analysis revealed, however, that weak correlation can limit substantially the signalling capacity of the pool. In addition, theory suggests a relationship between neuronal responses and psychophysical decisions which may prove useful for identifying cell populations underlying specific perceptual capacities.},

	abstract = {1. Responses of cat retinal ganglion cells have been examined with a view to specifying the characteristics that limit the detection of light stimuli., 2. Threshold is defined as the weakest stimulus that can be reliably detected by examination of the output from a retinal ganglion cell; it depends upon (a) the quantum/spike ratio, which is the mean number of additional quantal absorptions required to produce an additional impulse, (b) the temporal course of the response, which determines the time interval within which the maintained discharge is modified, and (c) the statistical distribution of the number of impulses that occur in this time interval in the absence of the stimulus., 3. The quantum/spike ratio changes greatly when adapting luminance is changed, and this is the predominant factor accounting for changes in increment threshold., 4. The time course of the response changes with adaptation level and area of the stimulus. This may account for the changes in temporal integration that occur in analogous psychophysical experiments., 5. Changes in the irregularity of the maintained discharge also affect the threshold of single ganglion cells. This is only a minor factor in the conditions of most of our experiments, but it may be important when unstabilized images and non-equilibrium adaptation conditions are encountered.},

Recently it was shown that single neurons in the macaque lateral intraparietal area (LIP) can predict the amount of time a distractor can shift the locus of spatial attention away from a goal. We propose that this remarkable dynamical correspondence between single neurons and attention can be explained by a network model in which generically high-dimensional firing-rate vectors rapidly decay to a single mode. We find direct experimental evidence for this model, not only in the original attentional task, but also in a very different task involving perceptual decision making. These results confirm a theoretical prediction that slowly varying activity patterns are proportional to spontaneous activity, pose constraints on models of persistent activity, and suggest a network mechanism for the emergence of robust behavioral timing from heterogeneous neuronal populations.},

We review studies of neural coding in primate posterior parietal cortex (PPC), drawing the conclusion that neurons in this brain area represent potentially high-dimensional inputs on a low-dimensional manifold that encodes the relative position of objects or features in physical space, and relations among entities in abstract conceptual space. We argue that this low-dimensional code supports generalisation of relational information, even in nonspatial domains. Finally, we propose that structure learning is grounded in the actions that primates take when they reach for objects or fixate them with their eyes.

A technique for inserting layers where pruning has introduced linear inseparability is also described. Two tests of ability to generalize are used—the ability to classify training inputs corrupted by noise and the ability to classify new patterns from each class. The hypothesis is found to be false for networks trained with noisy inputs. Pruning to the minimum number of units in the first layer produces networks which correctly classify the training set but generalize poorly compared with larger networks.},

	abstract = {The potential for neuronal representations of external stimuli to be modified by previous experience is critical for efficient sensory processing and improved behavioral outcomes. To investigate how repeated exposure to a visual stimulus affects its representation in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), we performed two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2/3 neurons and assessed responses before, during, and after the presentation of a repetitive stimulus over 5 consecutive days. We found a stimulus-specific enhancement of the neuronal representation of the repetitively presented stimulus when it was associated with a reward. This was observed both after mice actively learned a rewarded task and when the reward was randomly received. Stimulus-specific enhanced representation resulted both from neurons gaining selectivity and from increased response reliability in previously selective neurons. In the absence of reward, there was either no change in stimulus representation or a decreased representation when the stimulus was viewed at a fixed temporal frequency. Pairing a second stimulus with a reward led to a similar enhanced representation and increased discriminability between the equally rewarded stimuli. Single-neuron responses showed that separate subpopulations discriminated between the two rewarded stimuli depending on whether the stimuli were displayed in a virtual environment or viewed on a single screen. We suggest that reward-associated responses enable the generalization of enhanced stimulus representation across these V1 subpopulations. We propose that this dynamic regulation of visual processing based on the behavioral relevance of sensory input ultimately enhances and stabilizes the representation of task-relevant features while suppressing responses to non-relevant stimuli.},

Generalization occurs when some stimuli represented in the array on a test trial are the same as some of those represented in the array during training; the magnitude of generalization is determined by the proportion of the array occupied by these common stimuli during training compared with the proportion of the array they occupy during testing. It is proposed that this model can explain all the results that were difficult for its predecessors to account for. (52 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Attention is drawn to the similarity of the neuroses and psychoses to behavior observed in the dog during certain of the experiments.

	abstract = {We investigate self-sustaining stable states (attractors) in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. First, we study the stability of spontaneous activity in an unstructured network. It is shown that the stochastic background activity, of 1-5 spikes/s, is unstable if all neurons are excitatory. On the other hand, spontaneous activity becomes self-stabilizing in presence of local inhibition, given reasonable values of the parameters of the network. Second, in a network sustaining physiological spontaneous rates, we study the effect of learning in a local module, expressed in synaptic modifications in specific populations of synapses. We find that if the average synaptic potentiation (LTP) is too low, no stimulus specific activity manifests itself in the delay period. Instead, following the presentation and removal of any stimulus there is, in the local module, a delay activity in which all neurons selective (responding visually) to any of the stimuli presented for learning have rates which gradually increase with the amplitude of synaptic potentiation. When the average LTP increases beyond a critical value, specific local attractors (stable states) appear abruptly against the background of the global uniform spontaneous attractor. In this case the local module has two available types of collective delay activity: if the stimulus is unfamiliar, the activity is spontaneous; if it is similar to a learned stimulus, delay activity is selective. These new attractors reflect the synaptic structure developed during learning. In each of them a small population of neurons have elevated rates, which depend on the strength of LTP. The remaining neurons of the module have their activity at spontaneous rates. The predictions made in this paper could be checked by single unit recordings in delayed response experiments.},

We find clear evidence for ISN operation in mouse visual, somatosensory, and motor cortex. Simple two-population ISN models describe the data well and let us quantify coupling strength. Although some models predict a non-ISN to ISN transition with increasingly strong sensory stimuli, we find ISN effects without sensory stimulation and even during light anesthesia. Additionally, average paradoxical effects result only with transgenic, not viral, opsin expression in parvalbumin (PV)-positive neurons; theory and expression data show this is consistent with ISN operation.

	abstract = {Understanding reliable signal transmission represents a notable challenge for cortical systems, which display a wide range of weights of feedforward and feedback connections among heterogeneous areas. We re-examine the question of signal transmission across the cortex in a network model based on mesoscopic directed and weighted inter-areal connectivity data of the macaque cortex. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to purely feedforward propagation models, the presence of long-range excitatory feedback projections could compromise stable signal propagation. Using population rate models as well as a spiking network model, we find that effective signal propagation can be accomplished by balanced amplification across cortical areas while ensuring dynamical stability. Moreover, the activation of prefrontal cortex in our model requires the input strength to exceed a threshold, which is consistent with the ignition model of conscious processing. These findings demonstrate our model as an anatomically realistic platform for investigations of global primate cortex dynamics.},

This report describes how populations of neurons in cat visual cortex can use excitatory feedback, characterized as an effective "network conductance", to amplify their feedforward input signals and demonstrates how neuronal discharge can be kept proportional to stimulus strength despite strong, recurrent connections that threaten to cause runaway excitation.

In the rodent whisker system, the response magnitude to the deflection of a particular whisker is, in most cells, dependent on the direction of deflection. Here we use in vivo intracellular recordings from thalamorecipient neurons in layers 3 and 4 of the rat barrel cortex to elucidate the dynamics of the synaptic inputs underlying direction selectivity. We show that cells are direction selective despite a broadly tuned excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. Selectivity emerges from a direction-dependent temporal shift of excitation relative to inhibition. For preferred direction deflections, excitation precedes inhibition, but as the direction diverges from the preferred, this separation decreases. Our results illustrate a mechanism by which the timing of the synaptic inputs, and not their relative peak amplitudes, primarily determine feature selectivity.},

A single thalamic fiber can trigger feed-forward inhibition and contacts both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. The dynamics of feed-forward inhibition exceed those of each individual synapse in the circuit and are captured by a simple disynaptic model of the thalamocortical projection. The variations in the integration window produce changes in the temporal precision of cortical responses to whisker stimulation. Hence, feed-forward inhibitory circuits, classically known to sharpen spatial contrast of tactile inputs, also increase the temporal resolution in the somatosensory cortex.},

However, without ground truths, there is a real risk of missing a significant portion of the real responses. Here, we show that a common assumption, the non-negativity of the neuronal responses as detected by calcium indicators, biases all levels of the frequently used analytical methods for these data. From the extraction of meaningful fluorescence changes to spike inference and the analysis of inferred spikes, each step risks missing real responses because of the assumption of non-negativity. We first show that negative deviations from baseline can exist in calcium imaging of neuronal activity. Then, we use simulated data to test three popular algorithms for image analysis, finding that suite2p may be the best suited to large datasets. Spike inference algorithms also showed their limitations in dealing with inhibited neurons, and new approaches may be needed to address this problem. We further suggest avoiding data analysis approaches that may ignore inhibited responses in favor of a first exploratory step to ensure that none are present. Taking these steps will ensure that inhibition, as well as excitation, is detected in calcium imaging datasets.},

	abstract = {The primary somatosensory barrel cortex processes tactile vibrissae information, allowing rodents to actively perceive spatial and textural features of their immediate surroundings. Each whisker on the snout is individually represented in the neocortex by an anatomically identifiable 'barrel' specified by the segregated termination zones of thalamocortical axons of the ventroposterior medial nucleus, which provide the primary sensory input to the neocortex. The sensory information is subsequently processed within local synaptically connected neocortical microcircuits, which have begun to be investigated in quantitative detail. In addition to these local synaptic microcircuits, the excitatory pyramidal neurons of the barrel cortex send and receive long-range glutamatergic axonal projections to and from a wide variety of specific brain regions. Much less is known about these long-range connections and their contribution to sensory processing. Here, we review current knowledge of the long-range axonal input and output of the mouse primary somatosensory barrel cortex. Prominent reciprocal projections are found between primary somatosensory cortex and secondary somatosensory cortex, motor cortex, perirhinal cortex and thalamus. Primary somatosensory barrel cortex also projects strongly to striatum, thalamic reticular nucleus, zona incerta, anterior pretectal nucleus, superior colliculus, pons, red nucleus and spinal trigeminal brain stem nuclei. These long-range connections of the barrel cortex with other specific cortical and subcortical brain regions are likely to play a crucial role in sensorimotor integration, sensory perception and associative learning.},

Passive tactile stimulation evoked faster and larger postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) in M1-projecting neurons, rapidly driving phasic action potential firing, well-suited for stimulus detection. Repetitive active touch evoked strongly depressing PSPs and only transient firing in M1-projecting neurons.

We find that activity reflecting a current stimulus, the recollection of a previous stimulus (cued recall), and the stimulus category are distributed across S1 and S2. Despite this overlapping representation, S2 is important for processing cued recall responses and transmitting these responses to S1. S2 network properties differ from S1, wherein S2 persistently encodes cued recall and the stimulus category under passive conditions. Although both areas encode the stimulus category, only information in S1 is important for task performance through pathways that do not necessarily include S2.

	abstract = {A fundamental task frequently encountered by brains is to rapidly and reliably discriminate between sensory stimuli of the same modality, be it distinct auditory sounds, odors, visual patterns, or tactile textures. A key mammalian brain structure involved in discrimination behavior is the neocortex. Sensory processing not only involves the respective primary sensory area, which is crucial for perceptual detection, but additionally relies on cortico-cortical communication among several regions including higher-order sensory areas as well as frontal cortical areas. It remains elusive how these regions exchange information to process neural representations of distinct stimuli to bring about a decision and initiate appropriate behavioral responses. Likewise, it is poorly understood how these neural computations are conjured during task learning. In this review, we discuss recent studies investigating cortical dynamics during discrimination behaviors that utilize head-fixed behavioral tasks in combination with in vivo electrophysiology, two-photon calcium imaging, and cell-type-specific targeting. We particularly focus on information flow in distinct cortico-cortical pathways when mice use their whiskers to discriminate between different objects or different locations. Within the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (S1 and S2, respectively) as well as vibrissae motor cortex (M1), intermingled functional representations of touch, whisking, and licking were found, which partially re-organized during discrimination learning. These findings provide first glimpses of cortico-cortical communication but emphasize that for understanding the complete process of discrimination it will be crucial to elucidate the details of how neural processing is coordinated across brain-wide neuronal networks including the S1-S2-M1 triangle and cortical areas beyond.},

Here, we combined anatomical tracers with a novel multi-area two-photon microscope to perform simultaneous calcium imaging across mouse primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory whisker cortex during texture discrimination behavior, specifically identifying feedforward and feedback neurons. We find that coordination of S1-S2 activity increases during motor behaviors such as goal-directed whisking and licking. This effect was not specific to identified feedforward and feedback neurons. However, these mutually projecting neurons especially participated in inter-areal coordination when motor behavior was paired with whisker-texture touches, suggesting that direct S1-S2 interactions are sensory-dependent.

	abstract = {Trial-to-trial variability can result from both deterministic sources, such as complex dynamics or internal states, and randomness — that is, noise. This Review focuses on noise and its impact along the behavioural loop.Sensory noise is noise in sensory signals and sensory receptors. It limits the amount of information that is available to other areas of the CNS.Cellular noise is an underestimated contributor to neuronal variability. The stochastic nature of neuronal mechanisms becomes critical in the many small structures of the CNS.Electrical noise in neurons, especially channel noise from voltage-gated ion channels, limits neuronal reliability and cell size, producing millisecond variability in action-potential initiation and propagation.Synaptic noise results from the noisy biochemical processes that underlie synaptic transmission. Adding up these noise sources can account for the observed postsynaptic-response variability.Noise build-up in neural networks can be contained by appropriate network layouts, homeostatic mechanisms and the threshold-like nature of neurons.Motor noise results when neural signals are converted into forces. The architecture of motor neurons and their muscle fibres makes the conversion noisy. The brain organizes movements to minimize the effects of motor noise on movement variability.Beneficial effects of noise include stochastic resonance in specific cases of sensory processing and forcing neural networks to be more robust and explore more states.Behavioural variability, as observed in sensory estimation and movement tasks, appears to be mainly produced by noise.The principle of averaging is one of two fundamental principles applied by the CNS to compensate for noise by summing over sources of redundant information.The principle of prior knowledge is the other fundamental principle: it exploits the expected nature of signals and noise. The CNS often applies it in combination with averaging, such as in Bayesian cue combination in sensory processing.},

We have measured the responses of neurons in area MT of the alert monkey while we varied the strength and direction of the motion signal in such displays. The strength of motion is controlled by the proportion of spatiotemporally correlated dots, which we term the correlation of the stimulus. For many MT cells, responses varied approximately linearly with stimulus correlation. When they occurred, nonlinearities were equally likely to be either positively or negatively accelerated. We also explored the relationship between response magnitude and response variance for these cells and found, in general agreement with other investigators, that this relationship conforms to a power law with an exponent slightly greater than 1. The variance of the cells' discharge is little influenced by the trial-to-trial fluctuations inherent in our stochastic display, and is therefore likely to be of neural origin. Linear responses to these stochastic motion stimuli are predicted by simple, low-level motion models incorporating sensors having relatively broad spatial and temporal frequency tuning.},

	abstract = {Complex spatiotemporal changes of slow spontaneous activity occur in the form of propagating waves in the cortex, leading to the transient formation of a specific activation topography, followed by a transition in the topography. The topographies resemble the stimulation-induced activation patterns and the underlying structural projections, suggesting that they contain motifs of task-related activation. However, little is known about how propagation-mediated transitions between topographies are structured in terms of functional connectivity. Therefore, we investigated whether specific topographies or regions are associated with transitions involving long-range connections and hub modulation. We hypothesized that the activity level of the default mode network (DMN) at a given topography would affect the pattern of upcoming transitions, since high activity levels of the DMN are a distinct feature of the brain at rest. Using mesoscale voltage-sensitive dye imaging in the cortex of lightly anesthetized mice, we revealed that momentary levels of DMN activity are associated with distinct patterns of activity propagation and functional connectivity. High levels of DMN activity led to activity propagation across secondary and association cortices, increasing the centrality of a main hub region, whereas low-level activity led to global, diffuse, yet efficient changes in functional connectivity. Furthermore, low levels of activity resulted in increased long-range connectivity between frontal and posterior regions of the cortex. Our results indicate that DMN activity is associated with functional connectivity and wave propagation patterns, raising the possibility that the DMN may be involved in the modulation of long-range information processing associated with upcoming transitions. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution, we have revealed that increased DMN activity is associated with activity propagation to secondary/association cortices, whereas decreased activity is associated with stronger long-range frontal-posterior connections in the mouse cortex. Hub metric and global functional connectivity parameters were accompanied by activity level changes. These results indicate that the DMN may aid in modulating the structure of transitions.},

	abstract = {The mouse motor cortex exhibits spontaneous activity in the form of temporal sequences of neuronal ensembles in vitro without the need of tissue stimulation. These neuronal ensembles are defined as groups of neurons with a strong correlation between its firing patterns, generating what appears to be a predetermined neural conduction mode that needs study. Each ensemble is commonly accompanied by one or more parvalbumin expressing neurons (PV+) or fast spiking interneurons. Many of these interneurons have functional connections between them, helping to form a circuit configuration similar to a small-world network. However, rich club metrics show that most connected neurons are neurons not expressing parvalbumin, mainly pyramidal neurons (PV-) suggesting feed-forward propagation through pyramidal cells. Ensembles with PV+ neurons are connected to these hubs. When ligand-gated fast GABAergic transmission is blocked, temporal sequences of ensembles collapse into a unique synchronous and recurrent ensemble, showing the need of inhibition for coding cortical spontaneous activity. This new ensemble has a duration and electrophysiological characteristics of brief recurrent interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) composed by the coactivity of both PV- and PV+ neurons, demonstrating that GABA transmission impedes its occurrence. Synchronous ensembles are clearly divided into two clusters one of them lasting longer and mainly composed by PV+ neurons. Because an ictal-like event was not recorded after several minutes of IEDs recording, it is inferred that an external stimulus and/or fast GABA transmission are necessary for its appearance, making this preparation ideal to study both the neuronal machinery to encode cortical spontaneous activity and its transformation into brief non-ictal epileptiform discharges.},

	abstract = {Waves of spontaneous electrical activity propagate across many regions of the central nervous system during specific stages of early development. The patterns of wave propagation are critical in the activation of many activity-dependent developmental programs. It is not known how the mechanisms that initiate and propagate spontaneous waves operate during periods in which major changes in neuronal structure and function are taking place. We have recently reported that spontaneous waves of activity propagate across the neonatal mouse cerebral cortex and that these waves are initiated at pacemaker sites in the septal nucleus and ventral cortex. Here we show that spontaneous waves occur between embryonic day 18 (E18) and postnatal day 12 (P12), and that during that period they undergo major changes in transmitter dependence and propagation patterns. At early stages, spontaneous waves are largely GABA dependent and are mostly confined to the septum and ventral cortex. As development proceeds, wave initiation depends increasingly on AMPA-type glutamate receptors, and an ever increasing fraction of waves propagate into the dorsal cortex. The initiation sites and restricted propagation of waves at early stages are highly correlated with the position of GABAergic neurons in the cortex. The later switch to a glutamate-based mechanism allows propagation of waves into the dorsal cortex, and appears to be a compensatory mechanism that ensures continued wave generation even as GABA transmission becomes inhibitory.},

	abstract = {The cortex is organized in vertical and horizontal circuits that determine the spatiotemporal properties of distributed cortical activity. Despite detailed knowledge of synaptic interactions among individual cells in the neocortex, little is known about the rules governing interactions among local populations. Here, we used self-sustained recurrent activity generated in cortex, also known as up-states, in rat thalamocortical slices in vitro to understand interactions among laminar and horizontal circuits. By means of intracellular recordings and fast optical imaging with voltage-sensitive dyes, we show that single thalamic inputs activate the cortical column in a preferential layer 4 (L4) → layer 2/3 (L2/3) → layer 5 (L5) sequence, followed by horizontal propagation with a leading front in supragranular and infragranular layers. To understand the laminar and columnar interactions, we used focal injections of TTX to block activity in small local populations, while preserving functional connectivity in the rest of the network. We show that L2/3 alone, without underlying L5, does not generate self-sustained activity and is inefficient propagating activity horizontally. In contrast, L5 sustains activity in the absence of L2/3 and is necessary and sufficient to propagate activity horizontally. However, loss of L2/3 delays horizontal propagation via L5. Finally, L5 amplifies activity in L2/3. Our results show for the first time that columnar interactions between supragranular and infragranular layers are required for the normal propagation of activity in the neocortex. Our data suggest that supragranular and infragranular circuits, with their specific and complex set of inputs and outputs, work in tandem to determine the patterns of cortical activation observed in vivo.},

In mouse neocortex during the first postnatal week, waves of spontaneous activity originating from pacemaker regions in the septal nucleus and piriform cortex propagate through the neocortex. Using high-speed Ca(2+) imaging to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics of wave propagation in parasagittal mouse brain slices, we show that the hippocampus can act as an additional source of neocortical waves. Some waves that originate in the hippocampus remain restricted to that structure, while others pause at the hippocampus-neocortex boundary and then propagate into the neocortex. Blocking GABAergic neurotransmission decreases the likelihood of wave propagation into neocortex, whereas blocking glutamatergic neurotransmission eliminates spontaneous and evoked hippocampal waves. A subset of hippocampal and cortical waves trigger Ca(2+) waves in astrocytic networks after a brief delay. Hippocampal waves accompanied by Ca(2+) elevation in astrocytes are more likely to propagate into the neocortex. Finally, we show that two structures in our preparation that initiate waves-the hippocampus and the piriform cortex-can be electrically stimulated to initiate propagating waves at lower thresholds than the neocortex, indicating that the intrinsic circuit properties of those regions are responsible for their pacemaker function.},

We visualized activity propagation between S1 and S2 in rat cortical slices using flavoprotein fluorescence imaging. When S1 was stimulated, fluorescence responses extended into S2, while responses hardly propagated to S1 following S2 stimulation. The dominant activity propagation pattern from S1 to S2 was not affected by antagonists of glutamate or GABA(A) receptors. Ca(2+) imaging and electrophysiological recordings confirmed the anisotropic activity propagation pattern. This pattern could be formed as a result of serial information processing in S1 and S2. To test this hypothesis, activity propagation was investigated in cortical slices prepared 2 weeks or 3 days after trimming contralateral whiskers that provide massive inputs to S1. Supragranular activities in the barrel cortex were clearly suppressed. Furthermore, activities elicited in the rostral small vibrissae/mouth area of S1 near the border between S1 and S2 spread into the adjacent barrel cortex rather than into S2. Behavioral effects of whisker trimming were evaluated using a test, in which rats chose one of two bridges that had a wall on the right or left side only. Immediately after hemilateral whisker trimming, rats preferred to use the bridge with a wall close to the intact side. However, this preference disappeared 3 days after trimming. Modified activities observed in cortical slices after whisker trimming might be mechanisms for this behavioral compensation. These findings suggest experience-dependent formation of activity propagation patterns in the somatosensory cortex.},

This hypothesis is partially supported by strong evidence for balanced spatiotemporal dynamics observed in the cerebral cortex; however, evidence of a causal relationship between network interactions and cortex activity, as predicted by a branching process, is missing in humans. Here this cause-effect relationship is tested by monitoring cortex activity under systematic pharmacological reduction of cortical network interactions with antiepileptic drugs. This study reports that cortical activity cascades, presented by the propagating patterns of epileptic spikes, as well as temporal correlations decline precisely as predicted for a branching process.

METHODS: Mice were exposed to HI on postnatal day 10 using unilateral carotid ligation and global hypoxia. EEG and video were recorded for the duration of the experiment. Using immediate early gene reporter mice, active cells expressing cfos were permanently tagged with reporter protein tdTomato during a 90-minute window. After 1 week, allowing maximal expression of the reporter protein, whole brains were processed, lipid cleared, and imaged with confocal microscopy. Whole-brain reconstruction and analysis of active neurons (colocalized tdTomato/NeuN) were performed.
RESULTS: HI resulted in seizure behaviors that were bilateral or unilateral tonic-clonic and nonconvulsive in this model. Mice exhibited characteristic EEG background patterns such as burst suppression and suppression. Neuronal activity mapping revealed bilateral motor cortex and unilateral, ischemic somatosensory cortex, lateral thalamus, and hippocampal circuit activation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed regional differences in myelination, which coincide with these activity patterns. Astrocytes and blood vessel endothelial cells also expressed cfos during HI.
INTERPRETATION: Using a combination of EEG, seizure semiology analysis, and whole-brain neuronal activity mapping, we suggest that this rodent model of neonatal HI results in EEG patterns similar to those observed in human neonates. Activation patterns revealed in this study help explain complex seizure behaviors and EEG patterns observed in neonatal HI injury. This pattern may be, in part, secondary to regional differences in development in the neonatal brain. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:927-938.},

          Laboratory behavioural tasks are an essential research tool. As questions asked of behaviour and brain activity become more sophisticated, the ability to specify and run richly structured tasks becomes more important. An increasing focus on reproducibility also necessitates accurate communication of task logic to other researchers. To these ends we developed pyControl, a system of open source hardware and software for controlling behavioural experiments comprising; a simple yet flexible Python-based syntax for specifying tasks as extended state machines, hardware modules for building behavioural setups, and a graphical user interface designed for efficiently running high throughput experiments on many setups in parallel, all with extensive online documentation. These tools make it quicker, easier and cheaper to implement rich behavioural tasks at scale. As important, pyControl facilitates communication and reproducibility of behavioural experiments through a highly readable task definition syntax and self-documenting features.

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/706010},
	abstract = {Our understanding of the link between neural activity and perception remains incomplete. Microstimulation and optogenetic experiments have shown that manipulating cortical activity can influence sensory-guided behaviour or elicit artificial percepts. And yet, some perceptual tasks can still be solved when sensory cortex is silenced or removed, suggesting that cortical activity may not always be essential. Reconciling these findings, and providing a quantitative framework linking cortical activity and behaviour, requires knowledge of the identity of the cells being activated during the behaviour, the engagement of the local and downstream networks, and the cortical and behavioural state. Here, we performed two-photon population calcium imaging in L2/3 primary visual cortex (V1) of headfixed mice performing a visual detection task while simultaneously activating specific groups of neurons using targeted two-photon optogenetics during low contrast visual stimulation. Only activation of groups of cells with similar tuning to the relevant visual stimulus led to a measurable bias of detection behaviour. Targeted photostimulation revealed signatures of centre-surround, predominantly inhibitory and like-to-like connectivity motifs in the local network which shaped the visual stimulus representation and partially explained the change in stimulus detectability. Moreover, the behavioural effects depended on overall performance: when the task was challenging for the mouse, V1 activity was more closely linked to performance, and cortical stimulation boosted perception. In contrast, when the task was easy, V1 activity was less informative about performance and cortical stimulation suppressed stimulus detection. Altogether, we find that both the selective routing of information through functionally specific circuits, and the prevailing cortical state, make similarly large contributions to explaining the behavioural response to photostimulation. Our results thus help to reconcile contradictory findings about the involvement of primary sensory cortex in behavioural tasks, suggesting that the influence of cortical activity on behaviour is dynamically reassigned depending on the demands of the task.},

We formulate a generative model of the ﬂuorescence image, incorporating spike times and a spatially smooth neuropil signal, and solve the inference and learning problems using a fast algorithm. This implementation scales linearly with the number of recorded cells, and the complete pipeline runs in approximately one hour for typical two-hour long recordings, on commodity GPUs. Furthermore, this method recovers twice as many cells as a previous standard method. This allowed us to routinely record and detect ∼10,000 cells simultaneously from the visual cortex of awake mice using standard two-photon resonant-scanning microscopes.

In vitro, it can inhibit the aggregation and amyloid formation of a range of proteins including Aβ(1-40), a primary component of AD amyloid plaques. Despite the strong links, the mechanism by which ABC inhibits amyloid formation has remained elusive, in part due to the
notorious irreproducibility of aggregation assays involving preparations of Aβ-peptides of native sequence. Here, we present a recombinant expression protocol to produce native Aβ(1-40), devoid of any modifications or exogenous residues, with yields up to 4 mg/L E. coli. This material provides highly reproducible aggregation kinetics and, by varying the solution conditions, we obtain either highly ordered amyloid fibrils or more disordered aggregates. Addition of ABC slows the aggregation of Aβ(1-40), and interferes specifically with the formation of ordered amyloid fibrils, favouring instead the more disordered aggregates. Solution-state NMR spectroscopy reveals that the interaction of ABC with Aβ(1-40) depends on the specific aggregate morphology. These results provide mechanistic insight into how ABC inhibits the formation of amyloid fibrils.},

This general purpose package is built on National Instruments data acquisition and generation hardware and has temporal precision up to the limit of the hardware. PackIO acts as a flexibly programmable master clock that can record experimental data (e.g. voltage traces), timing data (e.g. event times such as imaging frame times) while generating stimuli (e.g. voltage waveforms, voltage triggers to drive other devices, etc.). PackIO is particularly useful to record from and synchronize multiple devices, for example when simultaneously acquiring electrophysiology while generating and recording imaging timing data. Experimental control is easily enabled by an intuitive graphical user interface. We also release an open-source data visualisation and analysis tool, EphysViewer, written in MATLAB, as well as a module to import data into Python. These flexible and programmable tools allow experimenters to configure and set up customised input and output protocols in a synchronized fashion for controlling, recording, and analysing experiments.},
